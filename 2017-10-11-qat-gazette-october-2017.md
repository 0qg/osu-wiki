Hello again everyone! Another month has passed, so here we are with the second issue of the **QAT Gazette**!
This month was full of events going on in the Quality Assurance Team, the Beatmap Nominators, and of course osu! itself. New Beatmap Nominators have been introduced for osu!taiko, osu!catch and osu!mania, the QAT and Beatmap Nominator Upheaval and the return of Mapping with Rewards are just some of the few topics in this month’s issue, so let’s begin!

## The Upheaval

The Upheaval was probably the biggest event of changes affecting the Quality Assurance Team and the Beatmap Nominators we have seen for a long time. For these who may have missed the details, you can still read more about it in the [Development Forum Thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/635507)!

### No More Tiers

As we discussed last month, the biggest point in the Upheaval was **the removal of the Beatmap Nominator Tier system**. As you may know, we previously split the osu! Beatmap Nominators into two groups - Tier 1 and Tier 2. Tier 1 members were able to make the first nomination for maps only, whereas Tier 2 members were able to nominate and also qualify beatmaps. 

Many people were not happy about these changes because of the lack of Tier 2 nominators. The amount of nominated beatmaps increased, while the amount of qualified beatmaps was reduced a lot. With the Upheaval, we have replaced the Tier system with an alternative **“probation” system** (more of this later in the blog!), allowing all Nominators to nominate and qualify beatmaps again! 

### Beatmap Nominator Rewards

Another point of the Upheaval were the Beatmap Nominator rewards! You may have already seen that all Beatmap Nominators received a “Beatmap Nominator” forum title and a special purple forum color. The older players among you will maybe know this color, as it’s really similar to the old Mapping Assistance Team color. It is planned for members of the Beatmap Nominators to also receive further rewards for their effort, including special titles for consistently active members over long periods of time. How we judge the awarding of this **Elite Nominator** title is still being decided on.

### QAT Leaders

The last important point of the Upheaval was the determination of a **Quality Assurance Team Leader**. The QAT Leader is supposed to promote discussion, organise further development, and provide a communication line between game developers and the QAT / Beatmap Nominators. Three of our QATs, [Deif](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/318565), [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508) and [Okorin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405) proposed themselves for the position, and after a voting period open to all other QATs and Beatmap Nominators, [Okorin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405) and [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508) were elected to the position. They will continue to push forward the remaining proposals from the Upheaval and beyond!

## Beatmap Nominator Applications

**New Beatmap Nominators have arrived once again!** Applications for osu!taiko, osu!catch and osu!mania from September have come to an conclusion, and we would like to welcome following new member to the Beatmap Nominators:

**For osu!taiko:** [Gabe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/654108), [Taikocracy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6256027), [frukoyurdakul](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7612550), [neonat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1561995), [xfraczynho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2192669) and [Chromoxx](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1881639)

**For osu!catch:** [Electoz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6485263) and [alienflybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114)

**For osu!mania:** [Asherz007](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9014047), [Litharrale](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3189995) and [Weber](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6410432)

All of them have joined the Beatmap Nominators as probationary Beatmap Nominators. As mentioned previously, we replaced the Tier system with the probation phase. The probation phase lasts for two months at most. In this time the Nominator is able to give beatmaps the first nomination only, but not to qualify them. You could call it a “test run”, where the probationary BNs are closely supervised by the QAT. We judge their modding ability as well as their behaviour in this time, to see if they deserve full membership of the Beatmap Nominators. 

Should they demonstrate an acceptable level of activity and quality in this time, they will become full members of the Beatmap Nominators who can both nominate and qualify beatmaps.

### The Qualification Cap

With the removal of the Beatmap Nominator Tier system, the amount of Qualified beatmaps literally doubled in the space of just one month, if not more! This ended in a Qualified stage for beatmaps lasting for up to 12 days or even more. Since this was awfully slow and unproductive, **we raised the amount of beatmaps that can pass from Qualified to Ranked per day to 8.** This will shorten the time that a beatmap set will remain in qualified hopefully back down towards the target of 7 days.

## Within the Quality Assurance Team

There have also been changes within the QAT too. Our team member [Cryptic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3728904) decided to step down from the QAT on his own after a short tenure to focus on IRL duties. You will be missed Cryptic, thanks for your contributions!

It’s not all sad news however, as we also have **two new additions too!** Please give a warm welcome to the Quality Assurance Team for [Naxess](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8129817) and [Raiden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2239480)! Raiden has joined to help manage the osu!taiko Beatmap Nominators who have grown a lot with the last phase of applications. Together with Mao, Naxess will assist with development of the Beatmap Nominator subdivisions. But you will hear more about this in future!

## Mapping with Rewards is back!

Some of you might remember the old Mapping with Rewards event, but [Okorin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405) has recently taken the lead and revived it. You can now choose from three awesome songs to create a beatmap set in any mode of your choosing for this contest. All you have to do is map them and submit - that’s it! Your set can be even ranked already when entering. After the 3 month deadline has passed, a team of dedicated judges will review the entries and decide which is the best.

The creator of the winning beatmap set for each game mode will receive several rewards, such as a 6 months of osu! supporter, a profile badge and more! If  you haven’t read it yet make sure to head over to the [Announcement Page](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2017-09-23-mapping-with-rewards-returns) and read more about it!

If you want even more mapping events, [Irreversible](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1287964) has something special planned for the coming month, so stay tuned!

## Summary

That’s it! I hope you enjoyed reading this month’s issue of the QAT Gazette as much i had fun writing it! (No, I really had fun writing it!) As always, if you have any questions about mapping, modding or other related topics you wish to ask us about, make sure to leave it below!
