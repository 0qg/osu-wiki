![Gameplay of osu!][osu! Interface image]

The first game mode and namesake which was based from the ouendan series.

## What is "Ouendan"?

_[Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan][ouendan wikipedia]_ is a rhythm game for the _Nintendo DS_.
The gameplay consists of only three elements: tapping circles on the touchscreen, dragging a ball across a fixed path and rotating a spinner very fast.
All these elements are timed to (covers of) popular Japanese songs.
It looks like this on the _DS_:-

![Gameplay example of Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan in Nintendo DS][ouendan image]

_Gameplay example of Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan in Nintendo DS_

The gameplay circles can be seen on the bottom screen, and the story on the top screen.
Each stage is basically a self-contained story about a person in trouble.
That is where the _Ouendan_ (Cheer squad) comes in.
Through the magical power of male cheerleading, the player have to help the people in trouble.

## ![osu! icon][osu! icon link] Gameplay

_Tutorial: [(Bundled with PC osu!) Original tutorial][osu!tutorial basic], [Ranked beatmap version][osu!tutorial rank]_

The gameplay puts emphasis on:-

- Adaptability and reaction to stimuli (that is, the hittable objects appearing all over the screen at lightning speed).
- Understanding of the song's beat and design.
- Input device control.
- Timing of hits on the object that appeared on the screen.
- Ability to spin the mouse (or pen for tablet) on spinners.
- Physical stamina and mental fortitude (especially longer, marathon-type songs).
- Proper positioning and hand-eye coordination.

These are some of the vital skills to become an _osu! rhythm master_.

The first step to begin the journey is to learn the basics (and theories) of the hittable objects (referred as _hit objects_ from here onwards).

### Song Selection

To access the osu! game mode, press `Ctrl`+`1` at the same time.

Alternatively, click on the `Mode` button and select `osu!`.

### Gameplay Basics

#### Playfield

![osu! interface][osu! Interface image]

_In-game interface of osu!_

The top-left bar is the health bar.
This will decrease at a steady rate (depending on the beatmap's difficulty settings), but can be replenished by tapping notes at the right time or spinning the spinner.

A perfectly timed hit (a 300 or Geki) will recover health more than a badly timed hit (50).
A total miss will take a good chunk of health out of the health bar.

On the right of the health bar is the total score.
Below that is the accuracy.
The circle beside the accuracy (and below the score) is a timer for the duration of the beatmap.

The number on the bottom left is the combo counter/score multiplier.

##### Hit circles
![Hit circles][osu_hit circles image]

_Some hit circles placed in a path to tap to the beat_

A thin, similarly-coloured approach circle on the outside of the hit circle will shrink over time.
Tap on the note at the exact point when it touches the white border of the hit circle.
A score burst will appear after tapping the hit circle, showing the score and health changes depending on timing of the tap to the beat.
The hit circle will disappear after the score burst.

To understand the hidden charm of hit circles, do not rely only on perception only; feel the beatmap's beats and rhythm.
It will help in juggling some of the visually-complex hit circles patterns found in later difficulties.

##### Sliders
![Sliders][osu_slider image]

_A single-repeat straight slider with active orange followcircle surrounding the slider ball and a slider tick inside the slider (small white circle)_

First, tap on it at the right moment, however, it does not end there.
A ball will begin to move across the path.
Hold the mouse/keyboard-button (or keep the pen onto the tablet) and follow the ball within the thick orange circle, surrounding the ball, as it moves.
The orange outer circle, called the follow circle, will appear if when holding onto the slider's ball, but will disappear when released.

Sometimes, as seen in the screenshot above, the ball may reverse its direction and must follow the ball back to the start of the path or vice versa.
The visual cue is a reverse arrow at the ending/starting circle of the path.

##### Spinners
![Spinner][osu_spinner image]

_A cleared spinner with spinner bonus_

Hold on the mouse/keyboard-button (or keep the pen onto the tablet).
From there, use the mouse (or pen) and spin the spinner in a circular motion (in either direction) until the spinner circle grows outwards completely.
A _Clear_ notice will appear to indicate that the spinner was completed.
If the spinner was cleared early, continue spinning to collect score bonus and gain some health back.

The outer white circle shows how much time left to complete the spinner.
This circle will turn red to notify that time is almost out.
Older beatmaps, using _skin version 1.0_, will have a meter/gauge to indicate how close to clearing the spinner.

The small box below the spinner shows spins per minute.
The number inside that box translates to the number of spins possible, if to continue to spin the spinner at that speed for one minute.
If mouse/keyboard-button was released (or pen did not touch the tablet) early during the spin, the spinner will stop reading the spin.

On the _DS_, this is a good way to scratch the touchscreen (or screen protector), especially on the higher difficulties.
In osu!, spinners have been toned down as to not be such a nuisance to complete.
The maximum number of spins per minute achievable is 477 which is also the rate at which the [Auto][Auto wikilink] game modifier spins while the [Spun Out][Spun Out wikilink] game modifier spins slower at 287 spins per minute.

## Play Styles

**[Refer to Play Styles page under osu!.][Play_Styles#osu! wikilink]**

## Controls

The default controls for osu! are:-

Mouse | Keyboard | Tablet/Touchscreen
---|---|---|
Left click(M1) / Right click(M2) | `Z`(K1) / `X`(K2) | Touching the screen(M1)

The hit objects in osu! will accept any input from the input device, as long as each hit objects was tapped in time.

If [Relax][Relax wikilink] mod was used, only the in-game cursor will work.
Use the in-game cursor to follow the hit objects with automated tap.
Spinners must still be completed.

If [Auto Pilot][Auto Pilot wikilink] mod was used, only the input from the input device will work.
Time the tap on the hit objects with automated cursor movement.
Spinner will follow the [Spun Out][Spun Out wikilink] mod speed.

## Scoring

_[Scoring Values can be found in Score under osu! Scoring Values section][Score#osu!SV wikilink]_

This section details all the intricacies of scoring, including mathematical formula.

### Grades

Grade| Condition
:---:|:---
SS | 100% accuracy
S  | Over 90% 300s, less than 1% 50s and no misses
A  | Over 80% 300s and no misses **OR** over 90% 300s
B  | Over 70% 300s and no misses **OR** over 80% 300s
C  | Over 60% 300s
D  | Anything else

A silver S or SS can be obtained by using the _[Hidden][Hidden wikilink]_ and/or _[Flashlight][Flashlight wikilink]_ mod.

### Accuracy

Accuracy is calculated by weighting the judgement gained on each note by its value and dividing by the maximum possible amount.

In other words: `Accuracy = Total points of hits / (Total number of hits * 300p)`

Term | Formula
:---:|:---
**Total points of hits**   | (50s * 50p) + (100s * 100p) + (300s * 300p)
**Total number of hits**   | (Misses + 50s + 100s + 300s) * 300
**s**                      | Number of
**p**                      | points

In other words, each _Miss_ counts as 0 points, each _50_ counts as 50 points, each _100_ as 100 points and each _300_ as 300 points.

Add them all together and divide the sum with the number of hits multiplied by 300.

- If only 300s: a result of 1.00, which means 100% accuracy.
- If only 100s: a result of 0.3333 (i.e. 100/300), which means 33.33% accuracy.

### Score

The score given by each hit circle and end of a slider is calculated with the following formula:-

`Score = Hit Value + (Hit Value * ((Combo multiplier * Difficulty multiplier * Mod multiplier) / 25))`

Term | Meaning
:---:|:---
**Hit Value**             | The hit circle judgement (50, 100 or 300), any slider ticks and spinner's bonus
**Combo multiplier**      | (Combo before this hit - 1) or 0; whichever is higher
**Difficulty multiplier** | The difficulty setting for the beatmap (see next header)
**Mod multiplier**        | The multiplier of the selected mods

Additionally each slider start, end and repeat tick awards 30 points, each slider middle tick awards 10 points and each spin of a spinner awards 100 points.

Additional bonus of 1,000 points given for each spin of a spinner after the spinner meter is full.

##### How to calculate the Difficulty multiplier

[Circle Size (CS)][CS wikilink], [HP Drain (HP)][HP wikilink] and [Overall Difficulty (OD)][OD wikilink] each give a tick on _difficulty point_.

The accumulated _difficulty points_ affect the **Difficulty multiplier** as so:-

Difficulty points range | Difficulty multiplier
:---:|---
0 - 5   | 2x multiplier
6 - 12  | 3x multiplier
13 - 17 | 4x multiplier
18 - 24 | 5x multiplier
25 - 30 | 6x multiplier

The limited highest is 27 difficulty points with CS7, OD10 and HP10.
The limited lowest is 2 difficulty points with CS2, OD0 and HP0.

CS cannot normally go below 2 or above 7 (requires direct modification to the `.osu` file).

Note that game modifiers (like Hard Rock/Easy) will not change the **Difficulty multiplier**.
It will only account for original values only.

### Hit objects judgement

**Hit circles**

- You get a 300, 100 or 50 from a normal hit circle depending on how accurately you click on it.
- If you do not click on the hit circle at all or click on it way too early, you will receive a miss.

**Sliders**

- The judgement for sliders does not depend on the accuracy of the initial hit.
- Sliders consist of slider ticks, which include the start, end and repeat points of the slider.
- You receive a 300 if you successfully get all slider ticks, a 100 if you get at least half of them and a 50 if you manage to hit even one of the ticks.
- Tapping a slider **too early** does not incur a miss, but will **reset** the score multiplier to **0**.
  - Not collecting the slider ticks, shown or otherwise, will not incur a miss, but will **reset** the score multiplier to **0**.
  - Missing the slider end does not incur a miss, but will **not** increment the score multiplier.
- You only receive a miss if you hit none of the slider ticks.

**Spinner**

- For a spinner, you receive a 300, 100 or 50 depending on the number of spins done compared to the length of the spinner.
- You receive a miss if you are not able to fill the meter shown on both sides of the spinner.

### Score/Combo Multiplier

The following each add a point to your score/combo multiplier:

- A successfully hit on the hit circle.
- A successfully hit at the start of a slider.
- A successfully touched end of a slider.
- A successfully touched on the slider tick.
- A successfully completed/semi-completed spinner.

The following will reset your score multiplier to zero:

- Missing a hit circle.
- Tapping a slider start too early.
- Missing a slider start or slider tick.
- Unable to fill up at least half the gauge of a spinner.

The following will not increase or reset your score multiplier:

- Missing a slider end (will result in getting Katu or 100/50 Hit).
- Spinner: 1,000 Bonus

### Life meter

The system used to calculate life drain and life gain is complicated so it will not be explained in detail.
It all revolves around the life difficulty setting which can only be set by the mapper itself.

**You gain life from:-**

- Hitting a hit circle. (Better judgement leads to more life gain. The last hit circle in a color combo awards more life.)
- Hitting a slider start, end or return tick. (Better judgement at the end tick leads to more life gain)
- Spinning and completing a spinner. (Better judgement at the end of the spinner leads to more life gain)
- Continue to spin the spinner (depends on how fast you spin per spin difficulty)

**You lose life from:-**

- Constant life drain.
- Missing a hit circle or a slider.
- Not completing a spinner.
- Not spinning after you completed your spinner.

**You reserve life from:-**

- Break time
- Spinning after you completed your spinner.

## Trivia

### Gameplay

![osu! smoke effect][osu_smoke image]

_Usage of Smoke_

![osu! smoke settings][osu_smoke_set image]

_Smoke in key bindings settings; hold `C` key to trigger by default in osu!_

- Depending on difficulty setting and the timing tolerance, tapping on the hit object _way too early_ will heavily vibrate the hit object instead.
- Releasing slider ball on empty slider path without hidden or visible slider ticks does not breaks combo nor gives any score.
  Slider only checks whether the starting circle was clicked, the slider ticks was collected, and ending circle was completed successfully or not.
- Changing spin direction in the middle of a spin will cause the spinner to slow down (spins per minute will go down to 0 to reset the spin orientation), then spin in the correct direction.
  The spin progress will not be lost during the reorientation (it will not increase instead), and will continue to increase on reverse spin.
- Smoke last longer than default in-game cursor trail.
  Apply smoke effects sparsely to prevent old smoke effects disappearing too quickly.
- Mascot for osu! is [pippi][Mascots#pippi wikilink].
- When played by [Auto][Auto wikilink], the player name will be _osu!_.

### Others

![Combo Fire][Combo Fire image]

_Combo Fire_

- Older version of osu! used to emulate some of the elements from the ouendan series before being removed or replaced.
  - Combo fire when hitting new combo milestones.
    - Removed on 5th of March, 2013, due to performance issues.
  - The first version of default skin, which was _osu!default by peppy_ skin, which provides an almost identical copy of the ouendan interface.
    - Replaced by nicer current default skin.
- The first three beatmaps ranked on the same day (7th of October, 2007) when the online leaderboard went live were:-
  - [Kenji Ninuma - DISCO PRINCE (peppy)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/1 "Kenji Ninuma - DISCO PRINCE (peppy)"), or `discoprince`; which was apparently mapped in around an hour.
  - [Ni-Ni - 1,2,3,4, 007 \[Wipeout Series\] (MCXD)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/3 "Ni-Ni - 1,2,3,4, 007 [Wipeout Series] (MCXD)") , or `Ni-Ni - 1,2,3,4, 007 [Wipeout Series]`.
  - [Brandy - Love Fighter (FFFanatic)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/16 "Brandy - Love Fighter (FFFanatic)"), or `Brandy - Love Fighter`.
- Notably, the older folders have their own naming convention (the folder names can only be found in _ancient_ beatmap packs) and does not strictly follow the current enforced `{BeatmapSetID} {ArtistName} - {BeatmapName}` format.
  - Downloading directly from the osu!website beatmaplist does follow the current enforced naming format regardless.
