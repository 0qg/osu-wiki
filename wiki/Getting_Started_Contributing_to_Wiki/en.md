Getting Started on contributing to the osu!wiki
==================

Thanks for your interest in making osu!wiki Better! As you can see, we have moved everything to [GitHub](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki).
So here's some few things in mind to get you started in Contributing to the new Wiki.


### Prerequisites

To be able to contribute to osu!wiki you must have the following :

- Basic Knowledge in VCS (Version Control System), Particularly Git (If you plan to make changes locally).
- Basic Knowledge in Markdown.
- a Github Account.
- a Markdown Editor. We either use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Atom](https://atom.io) but in some cases, Github's web Editor will suffice.
- a Markdown Previewer with **GFM** Support (Github-Flavoured Markdown). We use [Shiba](https://github.com/rhysd/Shiba) or Atom and Visual Studio Code's Built In Markdown Previewers (If you plan to make changes locally).

### Creating a GitHub Account 
 To get started in contributing to osu!Wiki, you must first sign up for a GitHub Account.

 1:) Go to the [GitHub Homepage](https://github.com).

 Now Click "Create an account" and you have a GitHub Account! You're well on your way to Contribute to the Wiki.

 ### Forking
 
 To be able to make changes to the repository, you must first create your own copy of the repository. This is known as "Forking".
 
 Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki).
 
 You should see something like this.

Now click the "Fork" Button on the top-right and it would prompt you on where to fork the repository.

If you have already made a fork, the Prompt will also say where was it forked.

Now click at your profile and GitHub would redirect you to where the fork is.

And you should see something like this.

Congratulations! You made a copy of the osu!wiki repository! You can now proceed in making changes.

If you, however, want to edit into your local machine, after forking, enter this through your command line 
(this would be ``cmd`` for windows and ``bash`` for Linux and MacOS).

```armasm
git clone https://github.com/<username>/osu-wiki
```
