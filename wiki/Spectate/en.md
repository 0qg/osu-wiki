# Spectate

Spectate, or spec, is when someone watches another player playing a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) in real time (with approx. 500ms delay). To spectate, open the extended chat and click on a grey user panel.

For this to work, you will need to have a copy of the exact same beatmap the player you wish to spectate is playing. When someone you are spectating starts playing a new beatmap, it will be announced in a private `#spectator` channel. However, if you have an [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter) tag, the beatmapset will be automatically downloaded via osu!direct and processed for you.
