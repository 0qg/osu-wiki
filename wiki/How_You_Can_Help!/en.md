# How you can help!

osu! has a very vibrant community composed of people from all around the world. And anyone can be a part of the community in their own way! 

And there are many ways you can help out in the community:

## Help out with the wiki

[The wiki](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki) is our official knowledge base about anything and everything about osu!. And as such, the wiki is always looking for more contributors to help keep the site up-to-date with fresh, new knowledge and/or translations.

If you are a newcomer to the osu! wiki, you can read more about it in the [osu! wiki Contribution Guide](/wiki/osu!_wiki_Contribution_Guide).

## Help keep osu! friendly and safe

In order to keep the official community hubs safe, osu! has a dedicated moderation team that monitors the forums and online chats around-the-clock. 

Fortunately, it is still easy for you to help keep everything safe here. If you want to help, you can…

- Follow your favourite channels in the [osu! in-game chat](/wiki/Chat_Console), or in the forums.
- If you see something happening that you think is inappropriate or disturbing in any way, use [the `!report` command](/wiki/Reporting_Bad_Behaviour) in the in-game chat to notify the moderators of it.

## Help other community members

If you encounter someone who has an issue with the game, lend them a hand! Whether it is a driver issue, a beatmap question, or gameplay questions, if you can answer it, you help the person in solving their problem.

if you want to lend people a hand, you can try…

- Choose a forum that sparks your interest:
  - [Help](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/5)
  - [Mapping Discussion](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/56)
  - [Storyboarding](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/20)
  - [Gameplay & Rankings](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/13)
- Mark the forum as read using the link at the top right.
- Follow any new threads, reading each one and helping-out when you can; you can use the unread icons to make sure you keep up.
- Read the [available guides](/wiki/Guides) to polish-up on your osu! knowledge. If the guides in there don't satisfy you, then you try contributing to them!

## Help check/mod beatmaps!

osu! has a dedicated team of reviewers to check if the beatmaps are ready to be ranked and played by everyone. However, that doesn't mean you cannot contribute to this sector. So if you want to help, you can…

- Look through or search the [Pending Beatmaps](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?s=pending) listing for any artists or songs you like and/or want to contribute to.
- Play beatmaps in the *Pending* or *Work-in-progress* stages and leave feedback in the beatmap's discussion page.
- Read the [Modding Guide](/wiki/Modding) and the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) to know the basics of technical modding and what makes a beatmap rankable.
- Join the `#modhelp` and `#modreqs` on the in-game chat and either join-in on the conversation or just follow along.
- If you have the time and dedication, make a [Modding Queue](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/60) to give beatmap creators a place to request you for mods.

## Help and/or join user-run community projects

osu! has a thriving community of technical and competitive people. They range from hobbyist tinkers to seasoned rhythm game veterans. There are a lot of proposals and projects being made exclusively for osu! and you can help them, or drive the future of osu! with your very own proposals/projects!

If you'd like to participate, you can…

- Browse the [Tournaments](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/55) forum; tournaments take time and a lot of manpower to organize without hitches, and you can help out by being a spectator judge in some cases.
- Check out what's going on in the [Development](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/2) forum; it is where most serious projects happen.
- Join a [beatmap project](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/53) and learn how fun collaborating with others can be!
- Start your own project! Whether it's bringing back dancing Pippi, or just making something cool for osu!; anything is accepted!

## Contribute to the future of osu!

Started in 2017, the osu!lazer project is the current focus of the osu! team, along with the new website, which is what you see today! <!-- I personally don't like this line: it's oddly short and doesn't really finish what it started. But I don't really know what else to put here. Maybe a link to a page explaining what osu!lazer is at the very least. If any of you guys have ideas, please tell me. -toaster -->

If you would like to help make these projects even better and bring us closer to the future of osu!, then please consider…

- Helping with the [osu!lazer](https://github.com/ppy/osu) project. There is so much to implement on the new version of osu!, and you can help make it happen!
- Make the [new website](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web) even better.

## Avoid being negative! Make people happy!

There is an old saying that you should become part of the solution, not the problem. Simply by following this old saying, you'd be helping osu! by making the community a brighter place. People will always complain, but there are still so many ways you can help lighten up the mood in the community:

- Be friendly to each other; life is too short to argue.
- [Report cheaters when you see them](/wiki/Reporting_Bad_Behaviour/Handling_Foul_Play). Please do not complain about them through other mediums; a simple `!report <username> seems to be cheating` can fix your problems much quicker.
- Go out-of-your-way to mediate negative situations and turn them into positive outcomes.

While this article cannot cover how much more you can help the osu! community, simply playing the game as well can make osu! even more awesome! Good luck out there!
