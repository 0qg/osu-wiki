# Ranking Criteria Council

The **Ranking Criteria Council** was a group of users tasked with reworking the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) in 2016.

Many of the rules that the [Quality Assurance Team](/wiki/Modding/Quality_Assurance_Team) (*QAT*) operated by when evaluating maps were unwritten and there were no mode-specific criteria at the time. This led to repeated disqualifications that the mapping community viewed as unjustified, so the Ranking Criteria Council aimed to bring everyone to common ground.

This project discontinued use of the [Ranking Criteria subforum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/87) from the public, only allowing posts from members of the council. Members of the council planned on discussing all aspects of mapping and forming their own Ranking Criteira proposals accordingly.

## Initial members

Members of the Ranking Criteria Council were hand-picked to represent different regions of players and mappers, mimicking membership of the [Triumvir Conglomerate](/wiki/BAT_Managers#triumvir-conglomerate).

The Ranking Criteria Council was ultimately unsuccessful. Only members involved in osu!catch promoted new proposals, while the other game modes did not make progress until the Ranking Criteira Council was disbanded and replaced with the United Beat-knights of Ranking Criteria.

## United Beat-Knights of Ranking Criteria

The United Beat-Knights of Ranking Criteira (*UBKRC*) was a new group with similar goals to the Ranking Criteria Council, however it was handled with less strictness. The group chose an intentionally stupid name to appear more friendly than its predecessor. The group was managed by [Okoratu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405) and [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) until completion.

Within the UBKRC, teams of experts were chosen to handle each area of the general Ranking Criteria and game-mode specific sections. Users could join if they showed an active interest in any group.

Between 2016 and 2018, the UBKRC reformed all sections of the Ranking Criteria to fit modern standards. Following its completion, the Ranking Criteria subforum was re-opened for community-submitted proposals.
