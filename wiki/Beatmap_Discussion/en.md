# Beatmap Discussion

Beatmap Discussions (also known as *Modding v2*) is a system to manage and simplify the process of [modding](/wiki/Modding). It aims to provide a clear and understandable interface, where the improvement of a beatmap is in focus.

When a beatmap is [submitted](/wiki/Submission), a discussion page is automatically created alongside the beatmap info page. When the beatmap is updated, the discussion page will be updated along with it. The discussion page can be reached by clicking on the `Discussion` button on the info page. <!--TODO: insert link to beatmap info page article-->

The beatmap discussion page consists of a few elements (from top-to-bottom):

- Mode Selection
- Title/Artist
- Difficulty Selection
- Sorting/Filtering Options
- Visual Timeline
- Beatmap Status
- Modding Field
- Discussions

## Quick-start: Using Beatmap Discussions

It's important to keep a few things in mind to use the Beatmap Discussion pages effectively:

- Choose the correct mode and difficulty you wish to mod.
- Select the proper section you are submitting your mod to.
- **Only post one issue at a time.** Do not submit multiple issues in a single post.
- Check to see if the issue has already been addressed when the similar post warning pops up.
- Do you like the beatmap? Give your hype to help the beatmap move closer to nomination.

## Mode selection

![](img/modes.jpg "Mode selection")<!--TODO: Add Updated Images-->

Mode selection changes the game mode between the different modes: [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko), [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch), and [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania). It is only possible to select a game mode if the beatmapset has a difficulty of that game mode. This feature is only really used for beatmaps which contain difficulties of multiple game-modes. For normal beatmaps this remains untouched since the discussion page automatically switches to the current game mode.

## Title/Artist

![](img/modes.jpg "Mode selection")

Displays the Title and Artist-name provided in the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor). To see correct formatting, romanization and potential tags to be added, see [](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria#metadata). Clicking this text will navigate back to the beatmap info page.

## Difficulty selection

![](img/difficulty-menu.jpg "Difficulty menu")

You can select different [difficulties](/wiki/Difficulties) through the dropdown menu. This will show all currently available difficulties, along with older deleted ones that have had suggestions/problems. The number that appears besides the difficulty name is the number of unresolved posts on that specific difficulty.

It is important to check this menu before submitting any mods, to see if you are submitting them to the correct difficulty and avoid any miscommunication.

## Sorting/Filtering options

![](img/modding-status.jpg "For your sorting needs")

Sorting/filtering options change the way beatmap discussions are viewed. Whenever an option is chosen, it changes both the modding timeline and the modding section to include only those types of posts. Different options include:

- Mine: Shows your own posts
- Notes: Shows any notes by the mapper or [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators)
- Resolved: Shows resolved posts
- Pending: Shows pending posts
- Praises: Shows praise and hype posts
- All: Shows all posts

## Visual Timeline

![](img/timeline.jpg "Mod posts, time-stamped")

The visual timeline displays all of the mods made for a difficulty which use a timestamp. Clicking on any of these will scroll down to the mod posted at that timestamp. Note that any filtering options will change what is displayed here.

The visual timeline is a useful tool for seeing how much a beatmap has been modded at a glance. A tightly packed timeline would mean that a beatmap has received a lot of attention already.

## Beatmap status

![](img/beatmap-status.jpg "Contains important information!")

The beatmap status bar shows everything relevant to a beatmap's spot in the [Beatmap Ranking Procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure). This includes:

- Hype train
- General info
- Watch/Unwatch buttons
- Beatmap Page button

### Hype train

The Hype Train tracks how many [hypes](/wiki/Glossary#hype) a mapset has received. Once 5 hypes have been achieved, the beatmap can be nominated by [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators). To read more about this process, see the [Beatmap Ranking Procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure).

Hypes can only be given by going to the General `(All Difficulties)` tab. It will not work through the `General` or the `Timeline` tabs.

### General info

General info shows the creator who submitted the beatmapset, the submission date and the date the beatmap was last updated. This includes status changes like a beatmap getting Ranked, Loved or Graveyarded. To read more about different types of statuses a beatmap can have see [Beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps).

### Watch/Unwatch

The watch/unwatch buttons allow for following/unfollowing the developments of the beatmapset. If a beatmap is followed new posts and replies that are made on that discussion page will give you a notification on osu! web.

You can manage all of your subscriptions through the [`modding watchlist` link](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/watches), which can also be accessed through the home page menu.

### Beatmap page

The beatmap page button will allow you to go back to the beatmap info page. This can also be achieved by clicking on the [Title/Artist](#titleartist) text. <!--TODO: Insert link, when that article exists at some point-->

## Modding section

Modding happens through three sections. These sections separate posts of different types and split them up into readable formats. The three sections are:

- `General(All difficulties)`
- `General(This difficulty)`
- `Timeline`

Aside from those, there is a 4th `History` section which shows all changes to the discussion page in chronological order according to post-time. Clicking on any issue will jump to the specifc post.

### General (All difficulties)

This category shows posts that apply to all difficulties. These are few and big in length but often require the most time for the beatmap owner to fix, as their scope spans all difficulties. Common posts in this category include metadata, notes and discussion on the beatmapset as a whole.

This is also where [hype](/wiki/Glossary#hype) can be given to push the beatmap closer towards nomination and the ranked status.

### General (This difficulty)

Posts in this category only apply to the currently selected difficulty. Common posts in this category include beatmap settings, recurring issues and general discussion on the specific difficulty.

### Timeline

The timeline category is where issues at specific points in a difficulty are addressed. Every post in this category must include a timestamp to be posted. The first timestamp placed will be the timestamp shown in the Discussion section. Any timestamps later on will be handled like normal.

## Modding field

![](img/mod-submission-field.jpg "The place where modding magic happens.")

The modding field is the place where [modding](/wiki/Modding) takes place and mods are written. Once finished writing, the mod needs to be posted. To do this one of the 'mod type'-buttons need to be pressed. The three buttons are:

- Praise
- Suggestion
- Problem

The praise button is for praise and encouragment. The suggestion button is used for posts about elements that aren't directly in conflict with any rules. The problem button is used for posts that are in conflict with the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria), or which are considered intersubjectively wrong. Once a button is pressed your mod will be submitted to the discussion page.

If you use the `Timeline` section, you must include a timestamp in the post. The first timestamp placed will be the timestamp shown in the Discussion section. The General sections do not require timestamps, but may include them.

If your timestamp submitted through the Timeline section is close to another mod already posted, you will have to confirm that the mod doesn't address the issue you are currently submitting. **Please check the discussion field before checking the box!**

It might be beneficial to `Pin` the modding field while checking other issues. Enabling the pin will allow the [modding field](#modding-field) to scroll with you, once you have scrolled down beyond the modding field.

## Discussions

![](img/discussions.jpg)

Discussions are where all modposts are categorized, and able to be sorted through. Discussions are listed differently depending on which modding category has been chosen. On the `Timeline` tab they will be sorted chronologically according to the first timestamp provided. On the `General (All difficulties)` and `General (This difficulty)` they will be sorted by last update. It is possible to change how posts are sorted with the buttons at the top of the discussion field.

Note that any [sorting/filtering options](#Sorting/Filtering) will change what is displayed here as well. Other buttons at the top of the discussion field that change discussion formatting include `Collapse all` and `Expand all` which will show/hide posts respectively.

As for discussions themselves, they have a variety of features as well:

### Communication
<!--TODO: There's probably a better name for this, but I can't think of one right now-->
Discussions can be opened, closed or discussed further by adding replies to a `Problem` or `Suggestion` post. This is done by clicking the `Respond`/`Reply` button. After finishing your reponse pressing `Enter` or clicking `Reply` afterwards will submit it.

While modding you may stumble upon closed issues which you have found elsewhere. In this case it may be worthwhile to re-open the issue. This can be done by replying like above but clicking the `Reply and Reopen` button instead.

If you as the mapper or mod submitter feel that an issue has been addressed you can use the `Mark as Resolved` button to close the discussion.

### Thumbs Up/Down

This will Like/Dislike the mod. This is useful for modders as it will give them [Kudosu!](/wiki/Kudosu!) which is needed for entry into the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators). So make sure to use this after a helpful mod.

There are a couple of restrictions around liking/disliking mods:

- Everyone but the mod submitter can give a thumbs up.
- Only [BN](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators), [NAT](/wiki/Nomination_Assessment_Team), and [GMT](/wiki/Global_Moderation_Team) members can give a thumbs down (to deny any Kudosu! given).

### Discussion timeline

The timeline to the left of discussion shows the timestamp the issue addresses. This is only available in the `Timeline` section.

### Tags

Tags display [important roles](/wiki/People/The_Team) that are relevant for the beatmap discussion. These include members like `MAPPER`, `BN`, `NAT`, `GMT` & `DEV`, who have more options than a normal user.

### Formatting tools

Formatting tools include:

- Permalink
- Edit
- Delete

Permalink grabs a direct link to the post. This is useful when cross-referencing issues that appear multiple places. Edit allows the submitter to edit their submission in case of mistakes. Delete allows the submitter to remove their submission.
