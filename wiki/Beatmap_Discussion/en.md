# Beatmap Discussion

Beatmap Discussions (also known as *Modding v2*) is a system to manage and simplify the process of [modding](/wiki/Modding). It aims to provide a clear and understandable interface, where the improvement of a beatmap is in focus.

When a beatmap is [submitted](/wiki/Submission), a discussion page is automatically created alongside the beatmap info page. When the beatmap is updated, the discussion page will be updated along with it. The discussion page can be reached by clicking on the `Discussion` button on the info page. <!--TODO: insert link to beatmap info page article-->

The beatmap discussion page consists of a few elements (from top-to-bottom):

- Mode selection
- Beatmap header
- Difficulty menu
- Sorting options
- Visual timeline
- Beatmap status
- Modding tabs
- Submission field
- Discussions

You can follow along with our images from [this beatmap](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/924551/discussion/) to get familiar with Beatmap Discussions or try opening a discussion page yourself!

## Quick-start: Using Beatmap Discussions

It's important to keep a few things in mind to use the Beatmap Discussion pages effectively:

- Choose the correct mode and difficulty you wish to mod.
- Select the proper section you are submitting your mod to.
- **Only post one issue at a time.** Do not submit multiple issues in a single post.
- Check to see if the issue has already been addressed when the similar post warning pops up.
- Do you like the beatmap? Give your hype to help the beatmap move closer to nomination.

## Mode selection

![](img/mode-selection.jpg "Mode selection.")

Mode selection changes the game mode between the different modes: [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko), [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch), and [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania). It is only possible to select a game mode if the beatmapset has a difficulty of that game mode. This feature is mainly used for beatmaps which contain difficulties of multiple game modes. For normal beatmaps this remains untouched, since the discussion page automatically switches to the current game mode.

## Beatmap header

![](img/beatmap-header.jpg "Beatmap header.")

The beatmap header displays the Title and Artist-name provided in the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor). Clicking this text will navigate back to the beatmap info page.

To see correct formatting, romanization and potential tags to be added to the title and artists fields, see the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria#metadata).

## Difficulty menu

![](img/difficulty-menu.jpg "Difficulty menu.")

You can select different [difficulties](/wiki/Difficulties) through the dropdown menu. This will show all currently available difficulties, along with older deleted ones that have had suggestions/problems. The number that appears besides a difficulty's name is the number of unresolved posts on that specific difficulty.

It is important to check this menu before submitting any mods, to see if you are submitting them to the correct difficulty and avoid any miscommunication.

## Sorting options

![](img/sorting-options.jpg "For your sorting needs.")

Sorting options change the way beatmap discussions are viewed. Whenever an option is chosen, it changes both the modding timeline and the modding section to include only those types of posts. Different options include:

- Mine: Shows your own posts
- Notes: Shows any notes by the mapper or [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators)
- Resolved: Shows resolved posts
- Pending: Shows pending posts
- Praises: Shows praise and hype posts
- All: Shows all posts

## Visual timeline

![](img/visual-timeline.jpg "Mod posts spread out on the timeline.")

The visual timeline displays all of the mods made for a difficulty which use a timestamp. Clicking on any of these will scroll down to the mod posted at that timestamp. Note that any filtering options will change what is displayed here. The visual timeline is a useful tool for seeing how much a beatmap has been modded at a glance. A tightly packed timeline would mean that a beatmap has received a lot of attention already.

The selected difficulty's difficulty settings are displayed on top of the visual timeline. From left-to-right these describe a difficulty's `Length`, `BPM`, `Circle Count` and `Slider Count`.

## Beatmap status

![](img/beatmap-status.jpg "Contains important information!")

The beatmap status bar shows everything relevant to a beatmap's spot in the [Beatmap Ranking Procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure). This includes:

- Hype train
- General info
- Watch/Unwatch buttons
- Beatmap Page button

### Hype train

The Hype Train tracks how many [hypes](/wiki/Glossary#hype) a mapset has received. Once 5 hypes have been achieved, the beatmap can be nominated by [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators). Hypes can only be given by going to the `General (All Difficulties)` tab. It will not work through the `General` or the `Timeline` tabs. Clicking the `Hype` button on the beatmap status bar will automatically move you to the correct tab.

### Nomination status

The nomination status bar, tracks a beatmap's nominations. Once a beatmap has received two nominations it will be qualified. To read more about this process, see the [Beatmap Ranking Procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure).

### General info

General info shows the creator who submitted the beatmapset, the submission date and the date the beatmap was last updated. This includes status changes like a beatmap getting Ranked, Loved or Graveyarded. To read more about different types of statuses a beatmap can have see [Beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps).

### Watch/Unwatch

The watch/unwatch buttons allow for following/unfollowing the developments of a beatmap. If a beatmap is followed, new posts and replies on that beatmap's discussion page will notify you on osu! web.

You can manage all of your subscriptions through the [modding watchlist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/watches), which can also be accessed through the home page menu.

### Beatmap page

The beatmap page button will allow you to go back to a beatmap's info page. This can also be achieved by clicking on the [beatmap header](#beatmap-header). <!--TODO: Insert link to  beatmap info page, when that article exists-->

## Modding tabs

![](img/modding-tabs.jpg "Modding tabs.")

Modding happens through three tabs, which separate posts of different types and split them up into readable formats. Additionally a fourth tab logs all changes to a discussion page. The number after each tab describes the amount of posts in it.

`General(All difficulties)` shows posts that apply to all difficulties. These are few and big in length but often require the most time for a beatmap owner to fix, as their scope spans all difficulties. Common posts in this tab include metadata, notes and discussion on the beatmapset as a whole. This is also where [hype](/wiki/Glossary#hype) can be given, to push a beatmap closer towards nomination and the ranked status.

`General(This difficulty)` shows posts that only apply to the currently selected difficulty. Common posts in this tab include beatmap settings, recurring issues and general discussion on the selected difficulty.

The `Timeline` tab lists modposts at specific points of a difficulty. Every post in this tab must include a timestamp to be posted. The first timestamp placed will be the timestamp shown in the Discussion section. Any timestamps later on will be handled like normal.

The `History` tab logs all changes to a discussion page in chronological order according to post-time. Changes are colorcoded; with green being resolved posts and status changes, red being new problems after nomination and blue being everything else. Clicking on any reference number in this tab will jump to the specific post.

This tab is not used while modding, but is useful for [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nomiators) and other staff to check issues chronologically.

## Submission field

![](img/submission-field.jpg "The place where modding magic happens.")

The submission field is the place where [modding](/wiki/Modding) takes place. Once finished writing a mod, the mod needs to be posted. To do this press one of the three mod type buttons.

`Praise` is used for praise and encouragment. `Suggestion` is used for posts about elements that aren't directly in conflict with any rules. `Problem` is used for posts that are in direct conflict with the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria), or which are considered intersubjectively wrong. Once a button is pressed your mod will be submitted to the discussion page.

If you post in the `Timeline` tab, you must include a timestamp in your post. The first timestamp placed will be the timestamp shown in the Discussion section. The General sections do not require timestamps, but may include them.

If your timestamp submitted through the Timeline section is close to another mod already posted, you will have to confirm that the mod doesn't address the issue you are currently submitting. **Please check each post before checking the box!**

It might be beneficial to `Pin` the modding field while checking other issues. Enabling the pin will allow the [modding field](#modding-field) to scroll with you.

## Discussions

![](img/discussions.jpg "Where the discussion takes place!")

Discussions are where the suggestions and problems from the [modding field](#modding-field) are placed once submitted. Here users visiting a beatmap discussion page can see posts made by all other users. Other users will be able to participate in discussion on posts by adding replies to a post. This is done by clicking the `Respond`/`Reply` button and writing a response. After finishing a reponse, pressing `Enter` or clicking `Reply` will submit it to the discussion.

As the mapper or creator of a modpost, you will be able to close an issue with the `Mark as Resolved` button once you feel an issue has been addressed. This marks the issue has having been dealt with to other users and removes it from the `Pending` [sorting option](#sorting-options).

Modposts can be reopened by any user by adding further replies to a post and clicking `Reply and Reopen`. This is used when modders stumble upon closed issues which have not been fixed fully, or a topic needs further discussion.

### Discussions sorting

Discussions can be sorted through the buttons below the `Discussions` title.

Initially, `Timeline` tab posts will be sorted chronologically based on the first timestamp provided. `General (All difficulties)` and `General (This difficulty)` posts will be sorted by last update.

Note that any selected [sorting options](#sorting-options) will change what is displayed here as well. Other buttons at the top of the discussion field which change how discussions are viewed include `Collapse all` and `Expand all` which will show/hide posts respectively.

### Thumbs up/down

If a modpost was helpful [Kudosu!](/wiki/Kudosu!) can be given. This can be done by anyone except the post creator by giving the post a thumbs up. This is useful for modders as Kudosu! is needed for entry into the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators).

If this feature is abused [BN](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators), [NAT](/wiki/Nomination_Assessment_Team), and [GMT](/wiki/Global_Moderation_Team) members can give a thumbs down to deny any Kudosu! given. If the abuse is done maliciously a penalty can also be given to abusers.

### Discussion timeline

The timeline to the left of a discussion shows the timestamp the post addresses. This is only available in the `Timeline` section. Otherwise the discussion timeline will be left blank.

### Tags

Tags display [important roles](/wiki/People/The_Team) below a users name which are relevant for the beatmap discussion. These include `MAPPER`, `BN`, `NAT`, `GMT` & `DEV` members who have more options than a regular user looking at a discussion page.

### Formatting tools

Owners of a post on a discussion can use formatting tools to make usage more painless. This includes permalinks, edits and deletions.

`Permalink` grabs a direct link to a post. This will show up as a reference number `#1234567` to other users, which can be clicked to quickly move to the referenced post. This is especially useful when referencing issues across modposts.

`Edit` allows a user to edit their submission in case of mistakes. This is not recommended to be used for replying to messages. Create a new reply instead.

`Delete` allows the submitter to remove their submission in case of severe mistakes. This feature is disabled for posts with discussion on them already to hinder deletions caused by heated discussion.
