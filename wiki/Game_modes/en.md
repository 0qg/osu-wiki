# Game modes

In osu!, a **game mode** is one of the four distinct gameplay configurations included in the osu! client (osu! [game mode], osu!taiko, osu!catch, and osu!mania). All of which are based on, or inspired by, other existing rhythm video games. 

*Note: Each game mode has its own icon/symbol: ![][o!s] ![][o!t] ![][o!c] ![][o!m] (osu!, osu!taiko, osu!catch, and osu!mania respectively).*

The default game mode is osu! (or, as it is unofficially referred to as, "osu!standard"). However, upon start-up, osu! will open with the game mode that was last selected. To switch between game modes, players can either click on the `Mode` button near the bottom-right of their screen, or by pressing `Ctrl`+`1`, `Ctrl`+`2`, `Ctrl`+`3`, or `Ctrl`+`4` to switch to osu!, osu!taiko, osu!catch, or osu!mania respectively.

## ![][o!s] osu!

*Main page: [osu!](osu!)*

*osu!* (a.k.a. *osu!standard*) is the default game mode in the osu! client, and is based on the original [iNiS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INiS "Wikipedia") rhythm video game [Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osu!_Tatakae!_Ouendan "Wikipedia")*. In osu!, the player is expected to tap hit circles, hold sliders, and spin spinners to the beat of songs.

## ![][o!t] osu!taiko

*Main page: [osu!taiko](osu!taiko)*

*osu!taiko* is based on the *[Taiko no Tatsujin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiko_no_Tatsujin "Wikipedia")* game series produced by [Bandai Namco Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandai_Namco_Entertainment "Wikipedia"). Made to mimic the feel of playing a real drum, the player makes use of a keyboard or drum kit to hit differently-colored circles on a single conveyor.

## ![][o!c] osu!catch

*Main page: [osu!catch](osu!catch)*

*osu!catch* is loosely based on a minigame inside of a [Beatmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatmania "Wikipedia") simulator, which itself is believed to be based on the *EZ2CATCH* mode from the [EZ2DJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EZ2DJ "Wikipedia") series. The game mode consists of falling fruit of differing varieties and a "catcher" holding a plate to catch the fruit.

## ![][o!m] osu!mania

*Main page: [osu!mania](osu!mania)*

*osu!mania* is based on a variety of conveyor-type rhythm games (namely [Dance Dance Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution "Wikipedia") and Beatmania). The game mode was chiefly introduced and implemented by [woc2006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1105845), and is made to mimic the feel of a real piano through the use of keyboard keys.
