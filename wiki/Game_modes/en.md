# Game modes

In osu!, a **game mode** is one of the four distinct configurations included in the osu! client (osu!, osu!taiko, osu!catch, and osu!mania). All of which are based on, or inspired by, other existing rhythm video games. 

*Note: Each game mode has it's own icon/symbol: ![][o!s] ![][o!t] ![][o!c] ![][o!m] (osu!, osu!taiko, osu!catch, and osu!mania respectively).*

The default game mode is osu! (or, as it is unofficially referred to as,"osu!standard"). Although osu! will open with the game mode that the last signed in player last played. 

Players can change game modes by either clicking on the `Mode` button near the bottom-right of their screen, or by pressing `Ctrl`+`1`, `Ctrl`+`2`, `Ctrl`+`3`, or `Ctrl`+`4` to switch to osu!, osu!taiko, osu!catch, or osu!mania respectively.

## ![][o!s] osu!

*Main page: [osu!](osu!)*

*osu!* (a.k.a. *osu!standard*) is the default game mode for the osu! client, and is based on the original [iNiS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INiS "Wikipedia") rhythm video game [Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osu!_Tatakae!_Ouendan "Wikipedia")*. Players here are expected to tap, slide, and spin to the beat of songs.

## ![][o!t] osu!taiko

*Main page: [osu!taiko](osu!taiko)*

*osu!taiko* is based on the *[Taiko no Tatsujin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiko_no_Tatsujin "Wikipedia")* series of games produced by [Bandai Namco Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandai_Namco_Entertainment "Wikipedia"). Made to mimic the feel of a real drum, players take advantage of the use of a keyboard or drum kit to hit circles of differing colors on a single conveyor.

## ![][o!c] osu!catch

*Main page: [osu!catch](osu!catch)*

*osu!catch* is loosely based on a minigame inside of a [beatmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatmania "Wikipedia") simulator, which itself is believed to be based on the *EZ2CATCH* mode from the [EZ2DJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EZ2DJ "Wikipedia") series. The game mode consists of falling fruit of differing varieties and a "catcher" holding a plate to catch said fruit.

## ![][o!m] osu!mania

*Main page: [osu!mania](osu!mania)*

*osu!mania* is based on a variety of conveyor-type rhythm games (namely [Dance Dance Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution "Wikipedia") and Beatmania). The game mode was chiefly introduced and implemented by [woc2006](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1105845), and is made to mimic the feel of a real piano through the use of keyboard keys.
