# Grid snapping

**Grid snapping** refers to the act of using the `Grid Snap` button on the right-hand side of the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor). Enabling it will force every [hit object](/wiki/Hit_object) that is interacted with to snap to the nearest position along the intersections of the grid.

The base level of spacing between each sector of the grid can be adjusted by pressing `G`, or by navigating to `View` -> `Grid Level`. Grid snapping can help align objects and patterns more easily.
