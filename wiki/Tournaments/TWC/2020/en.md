1. The osu!taiko World Cup is a country-based team tournament, played on the osu!taiko game mode.
   - **While this competition is planned as a 2 versus 2 setup, this might change depending on the amount of incoming registrations.**
2. Beatmap scoring is based on Score V2.
3. The maps for each round will be announced by the mapset selector on the Sunday before the actual matches take place. Only these will be used during the respective matches.
   - One map will be given as a tiebreaker map. This map will only be played in case of a tie.
   - There will also be a [Hidden](/wiki/Game_Modifiers), [HardRock](/wiki/Game_Modifiers), [DoubleTime](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) and FreeMod bracket.

6. Failed players' scores do not get added to the team score.
   - Reviving and surviving during a map gets considered as passing it.
7. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable map elements like storyboards and skins are allowed.
8. If the beatmap ends in a draw, the game will be nullified.
   - If a game is nullified the beatmap will be replayed.
9. If a player disconnects, they get treated as if they failed the map.
   - Disconnects within the first 30 seconds of a beatmap can be rematched at the referee's discretion. The played beatmap might be aborted for this.
   - **If a rematch happens, the roster for each team during that particular beatmap must remain the same. If that is not possible (the player who got disconnected can't get back in time) then both teams are allowed to swap rosters.**
10. Beatmaps cannot be reused in the same match unless the game was nullified.
11. If less than the minimum required players attend, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes.
    - If a team having the minimum required players online only presents 2 players in the lobby after the scheduled start time, they will forfeit their warmup.
12. Exchanging players during a match is allowed without limitations.
13. Lag is not a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.
14. All players are supposed to keep the match running fluent and without delays. Excessive match delays coming from the player's side can be issued with penalties.

### Scheduling instructions

1. Each stage will be held on **a single weekend**.
2. Matches in Group Stage may overlap.
3. All Double Elimination Stages will be held on either Saturday or Sunday, UTC+0.
4. Scheduling will be handled by the Tournament Management. Schedules will be released on the Sunday before the first matches of the actual stage. Tournament Management will try to create the schedule to respect the participant's time zone.
   - In the stages Quarterfinals and higher: Please inform tournament management before Sunday, if you expect a specific time slot to be unavailable in the following week. Wishes are tried to be followed, alas no promises can be made.
5. **Reschedules will only be considered if both teams agree to a time, this needs to be done and notified to the tournament staff before Wednesday at 23:59 UTC+0 in that particular week when your match takes place.**
6. **Reschedules may only be requested by a team captain.**
   - **Do not ask for a reschedule unless it is absolutely needed. The tournament staff still has the right to decline the request.**
7. Captains are responsible for their teams availability. The greater team size exists to ensure every team can provide at least two players for each match. If teams can not provide two players for a match, the match will be considered forfeited.
