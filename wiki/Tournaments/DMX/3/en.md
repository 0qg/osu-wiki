## Ruleset

### Tournament Scheduling

1. The tournament begins on the 3rd of November, and its runtime will be until 22nd of December.
2. Rescheduling may be done as long as the player asking for it can provide proof that both players agreed to it to the tournaments management.
3. If a player refuses to communicate with a reschedule, the staff may issue the reschedule without the consent of said player.
4. Matches will be played on weekends, unless rescheduled otherwise.
5. Reschedules can be made to weekdays, subject to referee availability.

### Tournament Bracket

1. The tournament begins with a Qualifiers Stage, for which the top 32 will go through, to go to a Group Stage, which decide the matches for the double-elimination bracket.
2. Group Stage will be played as BO7.
3. Round of 16 will be played as BO9.
4. Quarterfinals will be played as BO9.
5. Semifinals will be played as BO11.
6. Finals and Grand Finals will be played as BO13.

### Mappool And Map Rules

1. Mappools will consist of:
   - 4 FreeMod for Qualifiers Stage.
   - *to be decided* for Knockout Stage.
2. Players will have 2 bans for each match.
3. In the Tiebreaker beatmap players may choose between all mods available in the multiplayer lobby besides DoubleTime/Nightcore, HalfTime, NoFail and Easy.

### Match Rules And Instructions

1. The referee of the match will create a lobby and invite the players of the matchup into a multiplayer lobby 10 minutes before the scheduled match time.
2. Win condition will be set to **ScoreV2**, and the lobby type will be **Head to Head**.
3. Once both players are in the lobby, the match begins. A player will be automatically given a loss if 10 minutes without said player showing up for the match. The player may apply for more time beforehand with the referee’s approval.
4. If neither player shows up to the match in time, both players will be given a loss.
5. The winner of a map is decided by score as per the mp-link of the match. Failed scores will be treated as lower than not-failed scores.
6. For the beginning of the match, both players may at will select a warmup map before the actual match begins. Order of warmups will be decided by the highest roller. Warmups are not allowed during Group Stage.
7. Warmup maps must be less than 5 minutes of length.
8. The highest roller will have the first pick, and the lowest roller will have the first ban.
9. Ban alternation will be used. Here is how it works: 
   - Lowest roller -> Highest roller -> Lowest roller -> Highest roller. 
10. Bans and picks will always be after the warmup, and we’ll always start with the bans.
11. In the case of a tie, the Tiebreaker will be played.

### Situational Match Rules

1. If a player were to disconnect in a non-warmup beatmap within the first 30 seconds, the beatmap will be replayed. However, this may only happen once in a match per player. Any repeated disconnects will count as a map forfeit.
2. In the case of a tie, the beatmap will not be scored and may be picked again in the future, the picking order will remain the same. In the case of a Tiebreaker tie, the Tiebreaker will be replayed.
