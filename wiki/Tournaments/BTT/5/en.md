## Ruleset

### General rules

1. This tournament uses double-elimination bracket and single-player format. There are no teams here.
2. The score system used will be **Score V2**.
3. The mapset will be announced **every Sunday**, and the categories are NoMod, Hidden, HardRock, DoubleTime, FreeMod, Tiebreaker.
4. Match schedule is decided by the organisers. Players may ask for a reschedule if the current schedule does not work for them. Each stage of this tournament will last a weekend.
5. If there are no referees available, the match can be postponed.
6. If both players gets a tied score on the Tiebreaker, the Tiebreaker will be replayed.
7. If a player disconnects from the game, the opponent wins the round. The only exception is if the player disconnects during the first ten seconds of the song, in which the round is restarted.
8. Maps cannot be used twice in the same round.
9. Players have 15 minutes to show up to their scheduled match. If the opponent doesn't show up, the player who was supposed to play automatically advances onwards.
10. Any other rules changes or unexpected occurrences will be announced in the discussion thread.

### Rank restrictions

In order to make your registration counts, the player needs cannot be in the top #10,000 in osu!taiko game mode. This is meant to be a beginner's tournament, and many, if not all the maps are catered towards those who are below #10,000. We do not want an unfair advantage! However there are two exceptions to this rule.

1. If player's appropriate rank upon registration past #10,000 before the tournament begins but still below #9,000, its registration is considered eligible.
2. If you ranked up while the tournament is taking place, said action cannot be stopped, but please refrain from doing so (ranking up too far below #9,000 would result an elimination).

### Stage regulations

1. There are eight stages to this tournament: Qualifiers, Group Stage, Round of 32, Round of 16, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, Finals and Grand Finals.
2. Matches are seeded. This will happen in the seeding round (Qualifiers). More information about seeding can be accessed in the [seeding regulations](#seeding-regulations) section.
3. The winning condition for each stage are listed below:
   - Group Stage and Round of 32: Best of 7 (first to 4 points)
   - Round of 16 and Quarterfinals: Best of 9 (first to 5 points)
   - Semifinals: Best of 11 (first to 6 points)
   - Finals and Grand Finals: Best of 13 (first to 7 points)
4. After the Group Stage, only the top 2 players from each group will advance to the next stage.

### Seeding regulations

1. During the seeding round, there will be multiple lobbies available at various hours. Players will be free to sign up to the lobbies they please.
2. This match is mainly used to weed out the no-shows, however it is also used to file in any backup players who may be called upon to take place of a no-show in the future.
3. A private match will be created for all the players, and will be invited into their match when it is their time. Make sure that you are online at this time.
4. There will be no warmup during this event, but rather all the players will play through a shorter mappool.
5. Seeding will be made with the average rank of each player on each map.
6. Maps will be played twice in a row during the lobby. However, players can ask for a break of 5 minutes between each run.
7. Results will be announced on the Discord server after the end of the weekend.

### Match regulations

1. A private match will be created for your match, and both players will be invited into their match when it is their time. Make certain you are online at this time.
2. Each player can request one warmup map, but it must be **below 4 minutes**.
3. Here is how bans and picks will happen:
   - The first person to ban will be the loser of the `!roll`, then they will alternate bans. (Loser -> Winner -> Loser -> Winner)
   - The first person to pick will be the winner of the `!roll`, then they will alternate picks. (Winner -> Loser -> Winner -> Loser -> ...)
4. A player cannot ban a map from the same category twice.
5. In case of a tie, the tiebreaker will be played.
6. Results will be displayed on the Challonge brackets, and will be announced by the referee.

### Mappool regulations

2. Tiebreaker will be played under FreeMod.

### Scheduling regulations

1. Every stage is held during the weekend to let players practice.
2. Matches are allowed to overlap if referees are available.
3. Players must complete their match at the designated time or both players are eliminated.
