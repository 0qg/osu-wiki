2. To sign up, you must do the following **(All steps must be done for signup to count)**:
   - Fill up the Google Form on the front page.
   - Join the Discord server.
   - Change your Discord nickname to match your osu! in-game username.
3. You must stay in the Discord server for the duration of your run in the tournament. Failure to do so will result in your slot in the tournament being forfeited.
4. Everyone who signs up will be eligible to play the Qualifiers, with the exception of the following players who have forfeited at least 2 matches in SEAT 1 without prior notice.

### Rescheduling

1. The scheduler will schedule a time for each match. This time will either be on a weekend or a Friday night, depending on the provided availabilities of the 2 players.
2. If you cannot make it for the scheduled time, please contact your opponent and agree on a new timing before notifying the Scheduler at least **24 hours (one day)** before both the originally scheduled time and the new time. A screenshot of your conversation with your opponent regarding the change in time will need to be provided as proof.
3. Late reschedules may not be honored
4. if your opponent does not respond to your reschedule request within 48 hours, notify a scheduler. You will be allowed to choose a new timing of your choice for the match.
   - You will have to attempt to make contact via both Discord and Forum PM

### Match Proceedings

1. Before each match (except in group stages), both players are allowed to choose and play an osu! standard warmup with song length (not drain time) shorter than 5 minutes.
2. After warmups, both players will `!roll`. Low roll bans maps first, high roll picks maps first.
3. Each player will be given a maximum of 2 minutes for every action (ban/choosing maps). Failure to decide before the time limit may result in the opposing player making the decision.
4. Players have 1 round of bans before the first round of picks. In addition, for the bracket stage matches, players will have an additional round of bans before the third round of picks.
5. After a beatmap has been selected, players will have a maximum time of 2 minutes to ready up. Otherwise, a force-start may be done by the referee.
   - More time may be given under the referee's discretion.
6. Higher score wins the map
   - Failed scores do not count unless both players fail.
   - If a player fails, his score can still count if he has revived before the end of the map.
7. In the case of a draw, the player that did not pick the map wins the point.
8. For FreeMod maps, both players have to take at least 1 mod out of the following combination only: Easy, Hidden, HardRock, or Flashlight.

### Tiebreaking

1. The mappool is designed such that when both players reach match point (4-4 for a best of 9, 5-5 for a best of 11, ...), there will be 3 maps left.
2. Both players have to *Private Message (PM)* the referee which map they would like to pick out of the 3 maps within 2 minutes. **#multiplayer chat is strongly discouraged during this time**.
   - If both players pick the same map, that map is played.
   - If both players pick different maps, the 3rd map is played.
   - If one player does not pick a map within the time limit or says anything in #multiplayer that can be deemed as an attempt to mindgame, the other player is free to choose his choice of maps within the 3 maps.
   - If neither player picks a map within the time limit, the choice of map is randomised.
3. If the Tiebreaker map ends in a draw, high roll gets to choose another Tiebreaker within the remaining 2 maps.

### Priority

1. The following players have achieved either a top 8 placing in SEAT 1 or SEA RRT, or a top 3 placing in a country-based tournament. As such, they will have higher priority in joining SEAT 2:

| Priority Rank | Player Name | Achievements |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 1 | smh | SEAT 1 1st, osu! Indonesia Tournament 2018 1st |
| 2 | LoidKun | SEA RRT 1st, osu! Indonesia Tournament 2018 2nd |
| 3 | wuhua | SEAT 1 2nd, osu! Malaysia Tournament 2018 1st |
| 4 | Landegre- | SEA RRT 2nd |
| 5 | GSBlank | SEA RRT 3rd, SEAT 1 4th |
| 6 | Elegant Loli | SEAT 1 3rd |
|  | Dunois | osu! Philippines Summer Tournament 1st |
| 8 | M4-K1 | SEA RRT 4th |
| 9 | ShaneLiang | osu! Malaysia Tournament 2018 2nd, SEA RRT 7th-8th |
| 10 | Skydiver | SEAT 1 5th-6th |
|  | Rtyzen | SEAT 1 5th-6th |
|  | - Phantasma - | SEA RRT 5th-6th |
|  | Cleveland | SEA RRT 5th-6th |
|  | -Marika | osu! Philippines Summer Tournament 2nd |
| 15 | Tzero | SEAT 1 7th-8th, osu! Malaysia Tournament 3rd |
| 16 | SkyArrow | SEAT 1 7th-8th |
|  | NazzzF | SEA RRT 7th-8th |
|  | Rexeez | osu! Indonesia Tournament 2018 3rd |

- This list is sorted by highest achievement, followed by 2nd highest achievement (if any). Country-based tournaments are treated as equivalent to a 3rd place regional finish for 1st, 5th-6th place regional finish for 2nd, and 7th-8th regional finish for 3rd (if applicable).
2. The top 8 priority players that sign up will not play qualifiers. They will be guaranteed places in Group Stage as top seeds. In addition, to ensure that the top priority players do not meet each other until as late as possible, they will be placed in the following groups (in order, starting from highest seed): A, P, H, M, I, D, L, E.
   - If there is a tie between the 8th and 9th (or more) priority players, none of them will get top seeded status.
3. The remaining priority players will have to play qualifiers. However, all priority players will be guaranteed a top 40 placing in qualifiers (i.e. they will be guaranteed at least a mid seed for groups), provided they submit at least 1 score.
   - If a priority player would place outside the top 40 qualifiers, they will instead be removed from the rankings and be promoted to top 40 instead.
   - If the process of removing a priority player from rankings would knock another priority player out of top 40, that priority player is also removed. Rankings will be continuously recalculated until no new priority players are knocked out of top 40.

### Round Specific Rules

*Note: These rounds are assumed to be for at least 80 players. They will be scaled down if we get less players.*

#### Qualifiers

1. Map pool will contain 3 NM, 2 HD, 2 HR, and 2 DT maps.
2. There are no warm ups for Qualifiers. Please warm up on your own beforehand.
3. Each player will play through the 9 maps in the pool once, in a specified order.
