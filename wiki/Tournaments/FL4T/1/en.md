## Ruleset

### General rules

1. osu!mania Flashlight 4K Tournament is a **2v2 double-elimination tournament** with teams of **5 players maximum**.
2. The teams will first go through a **Qualifiers**. The qualifiers results will determine your position in the first sets of **double-elimination bracket** (during the Round of 24 and Round of 16).
3. Teams will be seeded by the Qualifiers results.
4. The scoring system that will be used is **ScoreV2**.
5. The tournament will hold a maximum of 32 countries for teams. If there aren't 32 teams by the end of the registrations, 16 teams will go through the qualifiers.
6. Everyone who meets the rank restricted requirements is able to sign up. Any members of staff **apart from organiser, mappool selector, and referee** are allowed to play.
7. Grand Finals will have a bracket reset if the team from the loser's bracket wins the first match.
8. Players who are not in the rank range are allowed to register. However, if they are not within the rank range by the time the registration ends, their registration will be removed. However, when registrations close players are allowed to leave the rank range.
9. After registration ends players are allowed to leave the rank range to any extent.
10. All match schedules will be written in UTC

### Technicals

#### Qualifiers

1. During Qualifiers there will be multiple lobbies available at various hours.
2. A private match will be created and teams will be invited into the lobby when it's their time. Make certain to be online at this time.
3. There will be no warmups.
4. Maps will be played twice in a row during the lobby. The best run will be taken into account for the ranking.
5. If any participants show up late to a Qualifiers lobby, they may play the earlier maps with permission of the referee. Otherwise, their team will have to play the remaining maps on another lobby.
6. Only two players from a team will be playing per map. There is no limitation on player swapping.
7. Remember only the **best 32/16 teams** will go through the Qualifiers.
8. If a team is seen playing more than twice the Qualifiers they will be immediately disqualified from the tournament. The best run will be calculated if playing each map twice.
9. The match lobby will be created by the referee, and the team captains of both teams will be invited. The captain is then responsible for inviting the rest of their team. If the captain of a team is not online, the referee will invite any other player from that team, and that player will be responsible for inviting their team.

#### Knockout stages

1. Teams have a strict **10 minute grace period** to have at least 2 players available to play the match. If the limit has passed and a team does not have enough players to play the match, the other team will receive a win by default.
2. At the start of the match, both captains roll. The roll winner picks first and bans second, and the roll loser bans first and picks second. What is more, rolls will occur after the warmups which order will be determined depending on each team side.
3. Warmups will be allowed always as long as they do not last more than **3:00**.
4. Warmups are allowed to be skipped by each team if they want to.
5. Players will have the lobby host so that they can pick the warmups they prefer to. After warmups end, host will be moved to the referee.
6. It is allowed for players to not play with their full roster in warmups.
7. Each team has to ban 1 map per match (apart from the Tiebreaker which cannot be banned).
8. Teams have 2 minutes to ban a map; if they fail to ban in the allotted time, that ban is skipped.
9. Teams have 2 minutes to select a map; if they fail to choose in the allotted time, the map choice will pass to the other team. This will have no effect on the order of picks afterwards.
10. For FreeMod picks, at least 1 player from each team has to pick a mod, either Hidden or HardRock. Overmodding is allowed.
11. The minimum combination of mods should always be followed.
12. Mods allowed in FreeMods are: Hidden and HardRock.
13. Players are allowed, but not required, to use mods on Tiebreaker map.
14. The team that sums up the bigger score among the 4 players (two in each team) when the map comes to an end will be the winner of the map.
15. Once the map choice is locked in, players will have 90-seconds to ready up. The referee will start the match when all players are ready. If the 90-second timer ends, the referee will force an `!mp start 10` command, and the match will start with whoever is in the lobby.
16. In case of a disconnection, as long as it happens before the first minute into the map, the referee must abort. In case a disconnection occurs way after the first minute then the disconnected player will be summed up with the score he/she had until that point. In case of not being able to sum it up, with the score favouring the other team, that team will win the point.

### Mappool composition

1. Qualifiers will have 2 NoMod maps, 1 Hidden map, 1 HardRock map, and 1 DoubleTime map.
2. Round of 24, Round of 16, and Quarterfinals will have 5 NoMod maps, 2 Hidden maps, 2 HardRock maps, 2 DoubleTime maps, 3 FreeMod maps, and 1 Tiebreaker map.
3. Semifinals, Finals, and Grand Finals will have 6 NoMod maps, 3 Hidden maps, 3 HardRock maps, 3 DoubleTime maps, 3 FreeMod maps, and 1 Tiebreaker map.
