## Ruleset

### Tournament rules

1. The osu! World Cup is a country-based team tournament played on the osu! game mode.
   - While this competition is planned as a 4 versus 4 setup, this may change depending on the number of incoming registrations.
2. Beatmap scoring is based on Score V2.
3. The beatmaps for each round will be announced by the map selectors in advance on the Sunday before the actual matches take place. Only these beatmaps will be used during the respective matches.
   - One beatmap will be a tiebreaker beatmap. This beatmap will only be played in case of a tie. **The only exception to this is the Qualifiers pool.**
4. The match schedule will be settled by the Tournament Management (see the [scheduling instructions](#scheduling-instructions)).
5. If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.
6. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable beatmap elements like storyboards and skins are allowed.
7. If the beatmap ends in a draw, the map will be nullified and replayed.
8. If a player disconnects, their scores will not be counted towards their team's total.
   - Disconnects within 30 seconds or 25% of the beatmap length (whichever happens first) after beatmap begin can be aborted and/or rematched. This is up to the referee's discretion.
9. Beatmaps cannot be reused in the same match unless the map was nullified.
10. If less than the minimum required players attend, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes.
11. Exchanging players during a match is allowed without limitations.
    - **If a map rematch is required, exchanging players is not allowed. With the referee's discretion, an exception can be made if the previous roster is unavailable to play.**
12. Lag is not a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.
13. All players are supposed to keep the match running fluently and without delays. Penalties can be issued to the players if they cause excessive match delays.
14. If a player disconnects between maps and the team can not provide a replacement, the match can be delayed 10 minutes at maximum.
15. All players and referees must be treated with respect. Instructions of the referees and tournament Management are to be followed. Decisions labeled as final are not to be objected.
16. Disrupting the match by foul play, picking inappropriate warmup beatmaps, insulting and provoking other players or referees, delaying the match or other deliberate inappropriate misbehavior is strictly prohibited.
17. The multiplayer chatrooms are subject to the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules).
    - Breaking the chat rules will result in a silence. Silenced players can not participate in multiplayer matches and must be exchanged for the time being.
18. **The seeding method will be revealed after all the teams have played their Qualifier rounds.**
19. Unexpected incidents are handled by the tournament Management. Referees may allow higher tolerance depending on the circumstances. This is up to their discretion.
20. Penalties for violating the tournament rules may include:
    - Exclusion of specific players for one beatmap
    - Exclusion of specific players for an entire match
    - Declaring the match as Lost by Default
    - Disqualification from the entire tournament
    - Disqualification from the current and future official tournaments until appealed
    - Any modification of these rules will be announced.

   - Tournament Management will create a list of potential candidates for a country's team.
   - Tournament Management will declare one candidate to the captain of the country's team, albeit temporarily.
   - The declared captain can form their team from the candidate list of their country.
2. To ensure valid and serious registrations, every registered user will be checked by the Tournament Management.
   - Every registered user will be assigned to their respective country's candidate list.
   - To be successfully accepted on the list, a player's global osu! performance ranking must be better than #5000.
   - To be successfully accepted on the list, a player must not have violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) within the last 12 months.
3. All successfully formed teams will be published after the Registration Phase.
   - **A team should have at least 6 players registered to have the chance to play the Qualifier stage.**
   - **The top 32 seeded teams will qualify to the Round of 32.**

   - **From Quarterfinals onwards, the number of bans increases to two. However, each team may not ban more than one map of any mod bracket (excluding NoMod).**
4. Beatmap selection will alternate between each captain selecting a beatmap out of the mappool.
5. Each captain must use "!roll" once in #multiplayer.
   - The captain with the higher roll decides which team **picks** first.
   - The captain with the lower roll decides which team **bans** first.
   - **From Quarterfinals onwards the team that bans first will ban one map, then the other team will ban two maps, then finally the first team will make their final ban.**
6. Captains may pick freely from any mod pool.
   - In the case of a tie, the tiebreaker beatmap will be played.
7. The results of the Qualifier stage will be published via a statistics sheet.

5. **Reschedules will only be considered if both teams agree to a time at least 48 hours before the first match in that particular stage.**

   - **Do not ask for a reschedule unless it is absolutely necessary. The tournament staff has the right to decline the request.**
