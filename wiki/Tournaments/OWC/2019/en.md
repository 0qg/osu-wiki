## Ruleset

### Tournament Rules

1. The osu! World Cup is a country-based team tournament, played on the osu! game mode.
   - While this competition is planned as a 4 versus 4 setup, this might change depending on the amount of incoming registrations.
2. Beatmap scoring is based on Score V2.
3. The beatmaps for each round will be announced by the mapset selector in advance on the Sunday before the actual matches take place. Only these will be used during the respective matches.
   - **The Qualifiers pool will be announced the 2nd of November.**
   - One beatmap will be given as a tiebreaker beatmap. This beatmap will only be played in case of a tie. **The only exception to this is the Qualifiers pool.**
4. Match schedule will be settled by the Tournament Management (see below).
5. If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.
6. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable beatmap elements like storyboards and skins are allowed.
7. If the beatmap ends in a draw, the game will be nullified.
8. If a player disconnects, they get treated as if they failed the beatmap.
   - Disconnects within 30 seconds after beatmap begin can be rematched. This is up to the referee's discretion. The played beatmap might be aborted for this.
9. Beatmaps cannot be reused in the same match unless the game was nullified.
10. If less than the minimum required players attend, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes.
11. Exchanging players during a match is allowed without limitations.
   - **In the event that a map rematch is required, exchanging players isn't allowed. An exception can be made, up to the referee's discretion, if the previous roster is unavailable to play.**
12. Lag is not a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.
13. All players are supposed to keep the match running fluent and without delays. Excessive match delays coming from the player's side can be issued with penalties.
14. If a player disconnects between the beatmaps and the team can not provide an exchange, the match can be delayed 10 minutes at maximum.
15. All players and referees must be treated with respect. Instructions of the referees and tournament management is to be followed. Decisions labeled as final are not to be objected.
