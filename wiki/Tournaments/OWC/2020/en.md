## Ruleset

### Tournament rules

1. The osu! World Cup is a country-based team tournament played on the osu! game mode.
   - While this competition is planned as a 4 versus 4 setup, this may change depending on the number of incoming registrations.
2. Beatmap scoring is based on Score V2.
3. The beatmaps for each round will be announced by the map selectors in advance on the Sunday before the actual matches take place. Only these beatmaps will be used during the respective matches.
   - One beatmap will be a tiebreaker beatmap. This beatmap will only be played in case of a tie. **The only exception to this is the Qualifiers pool.**
4. The match schedule will be settled by the Tournament Management (see the [scheduling instructions](#scheduling-instructions)).
5. If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.
6. Use of the Visual Settings to alter background dim or disable beatmap elements like storyboards and skins are allowed.
7. If the beatmap ends in a draw, the map will be nullified and replayed.
8. If a player disconnects, their scores will not be counted towards their team's total.
   - Disconnects within 30 seconds or 25% of the beatmap length (whichever happens first) after beatmap begin can be aborted and/or rematched. This is up to the referee's discretion.
9. Beatmaps cannot be reused in the same match unless the map was nullified.
10. If less than the minimum required players attend, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes.
11. Exchanging players during a match is allowed without limitations.
    - **If a map rematch is required, exchanging players is not allowed. With the referee's discretion, an exception can be made if the previous roster is unavailable to play.**
12. Lag is not a valid reason to nullify a beatmap.
13. All players are supposed to keep the match running fluently and without delays. Penalties can be issued to the players if they cause excessive match delays.
14. If a player disconnects between maps and the team cannot provide a replacement, the match can be delayed 10 minutes at maximum.
15. All players and referees must be treated with respect. Instructions of the referees and tournament Management are to be followed. Decisions labeled as final are not to be objected.
16. Disrupting the match by foul play, insulting and provoking other players or referees, delaying the match or other deliberate inappropriate misbehavior is strictly prohibited.
17. The multiplayer chatrooms are subject to the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules).
    - Breaking the chat rules will result in a silence. Silenced players can not participate in multiplayer matches and must be exchanged for the time being.
18. **The seeding method will be revealed after all the teams have played their Qualifier rounds.**
19. Unexpected incidents are handled by the tournament management. Referees may allow higher tolerance depending on the circumstances. This is up to their discretion.
20. Penalties for violating the tournament rules may include:
    - Exclusion of specific players for one beatmap
    - Exclusion of specific players for an entire match
    - Declaring the match as Lost by Default
    - Disqualification from the entire tournament
    - Disqualification from the current and future official tournaments until appealed
    - Any modification of these rules will be announced.

### Tournament registration

1. Every user interested in joining their country's team will sign up individually.
   - Tournament Management will create a list of potential candidates for a country's team.
   - Tournament Management will declare one candidate to the captain of the country's team, albeit temporarily.
   - The declared captain can form their team from the candidate list of their country.
2. To ensure valid and serious registrations, every registered user will be checked by the Tournament Management.
   - Every registered user will be assigned to their respective country's candidate list.
   - To be successfully accepted on the list, a player's global osu! performance ranking must be better than #5000.
   - To be successfully accepted on the list, a player must not have violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) within the last 12 months.
3. All successfully formed teams will be published after the Registration Phase.
   - **A team should have at least 6 players registered to have the chance to play the Qualifier stage.**
   - **The top 32 seeded teams will qualify to the Round of 32.**
4. Beatmap selectors must not participate as players in this tournament.

### Stage instructions

1. In the Qualifier stage, all teams will play a specific pool designed by the map selectors.
2. The pool will contain 4 brackets: NoMod, [Hidden](/wiki/Game_modifier/Hidden), [HardRock](/wiki/Game_modifier/Hard_Rock), [DoubleTime](/wiki/Game_modifier/Double_Time). There will not be a tiebreaker for this stage.
3. The Qualifier pool contains 10 maps. There will be 4 maps under the NoMod bracket and 2 maps for the other mod brackets.
4. Teams will have to play the map pool twice at a designated time. Their best combined score will be used for seeding.
5. The mappool will be played in the order listed above.
6. Each team must have 4 players for each map. They can be exchanged freely after a map is concluded.
7. There will be a 5-minute break in between the first and second playthrough of the map pool.
8. All teams will play their qualifiers in separate rooms. *We suggest teams not to broadcast or share their results to avoid seed manipulation*.
9. The top 32 seeded teams will advance to the Round of 32.
10. Following the Qualifiers, Double Elimination stages will be played. This means that the winner moves to the next stage and the losing team gets moved to the losers bracket.
11. Teams in the losers bracket must play 2 matches each weekend starting from the Quarterfinals.

#### Winning conditions

- The Round of 32 and Round of 16 will be best of 9 (first team to 5 wins).
- The Quarterfinals and Semifinals will be best of 11 (first team to 6 wins).
- The Finals and Grand Finals are will be best of 13 (first team to 7 wins).

### Match instructions

1. A referee will create a multiplayer room 15 minutes in advance. Players must gather during this period.
   - Room settings are osu!, Team-Vs., Win Condition: 'ScoreV2'. Room name must be "OWC2020: (TeamRed) vs (TeamBlue)".
   - The team mentioned first in the room name must be the red team, the team mentioned second in the room name must be the blue team.
2. Each captain can ban **one beatmap** to be selected from the pool in the Round of 32 and Round of 16. These beatmaps are not allowed to be picked by any team in the entire match.
   - **From Quarterfinals onwards, the number of bans increases to two. However, each team may not ban more than one map of any mod bracket (excluding NoMod).**
3. Beatmap selection will alternate between each captain selecting a beatmap out of the mappool.
4. Each captain must use "!roll" once in #multiplayer.
   - The captain with the higher roll decides which team **picks** first.
   - The captain with the lower roll decides which team **bans** first.
   - **From Quarterfinals onwards the team that bans first will ban one map, then the other team will ban two maps, then finally the first team will make their final ban.**
5. Teams will have 2 minutes to pick a beatmap and 2 minutes to get ready.
   - In case a team takes more than 2 minutes to pick a map, they will recieve a warning from the referee, on subsequent occurrences the referee will pick a random map available to pick from the mappool using `!roll X`, where X is the number of available maps to pick in the mappool.
   - Each team will receive a "tactical timeout" of **two minutes**, which can be used at any time during their team's pick, **once per match**. *The tactical timeout is optional, and is not required to be used*.
6. The results of the Qualifier stage will be published via a statistics sheet.

### Mappool instructions

2. Each mappool consists of 5 brackets: NoMod, [Hidden](/wiki/Game_modifier/Hidden), [HardRock](/wiki/Game_modifier/Hard_Rock), [DoubleTime](/wiki/Game_modifier/Double_Time) and FreeMod.

5. **Reschedules will only be considered if both teams agree to a time at least 48 hours before the first match in that particular stage.**
6. **Reschedules may only be requested by a team captain.**
   - **Do not ask for a reschedule unless it is absolutely necessary. The tournament staff has the right to decline the request.**
7. Captains are responsible for their teams' availability. The greater team size exists to ensure every team can provide at least four players for each match. If teams can not provide four players for a match, the match will be considered forfeited.
