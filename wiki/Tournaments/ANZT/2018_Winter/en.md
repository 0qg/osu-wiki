* Participants must have an Australian or New Zealand flag on their osu profile.
* Matches will be **Head to Head** with **Score V2** as the scoring system.
* Any harassment or abuse of a staff member or other players will result in an expulsion from the tournament.
* If a problem occurs where rules are not clear, use common sense. Further questions can be directed to admins. Administration has final say regarding these situations.

### Match Rules:

* Referees will create the lobby and invite players 10 minutes before the designated match time.
* Players have up to ten minutes after their designated start time to move into the lobby. Failure to show will result in a forfeit. If both players are absent, the match will either be rescheduled or end in double forfeit to the discretion of the administration.
* If a player disconnects within the first 30 seconds of a map, it will be aborted and replayed. Any disconnects afterwards will be a forfeit of that map.
* Disconnects may only occur once per match per player. It will count as a forfeit after the first time.
* Highest !roll has first warmup, ban and pick.
* Each player is allowed one ban.
* Each player is allowed one warmup. Warmups must not be longer than 5 minutes, must not be in any ANZT5W mappool and must be submitted.
* One player may not pick from the same mod pool twice in a row (HD/HR/DT/FreeMod). This does not apply to NoMod.
* In a FreeMod pick, each player **must select a mod(s)** (HD/HR/HDHR). **NoMod is not allowed**.
* Failed scores will only count if the player revives before the end. If a player fails and their opponent does not, the point goes to the latter. If both players fail, the point goes to the higher failed score.
