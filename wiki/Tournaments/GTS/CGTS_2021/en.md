## Ruleset

### General rules

1. The Beginners Global Taiko Showdown is a **2v2 double-elimination tournament** with teams of **5 players maximum**.
2. The teams will first go through a **Qualifiers**. Then they will play in a **Group Stage** and finally play in a **double-elimination bracket**.
3. The scoring system that will be used is **ScoreV2**.
4. Any player who meets the requirements stated in the [rank restrictions](#rank-restrictions) section is allowed to sign up. Since BGTS will aim to get badged, some players might be declined by the osu! staff (via screening).
5. Any members of staff apart from **organisers, map selectors (both general and All Stars), and referees** are allowed to play.
6. Players and staff members must have read this ruleset entirely (and we will assume you did so throughout the tournament).
7. All participants must stay respectful and keep a proper attitude. Not following this rule can result in a ban/blacklist from the tournament. This rule concerns all the staff as well.
8. Any rule changes or unexpected occurences will be announced in the AGTS Discord server.

### Rank restrictions

1. Players must be within the rank of #8,000 or above during registrations. This means that they have to be in this rank range **until the end of registrations**.
2. Players are not allowed to rank up further than **#7,000 during the tournament**. If they pass the limit, they will be disqualified immediately.
3. Players must sign up with the country flag of their profile.
4. Players must join the Discord server of the tournament.

### Tournament registration and teams creation

1. In order to participate, players need to meet the criteria stated in the [rank restriction](#rank-restrictions) section.
2. Players sign up individually. When their registration is accepted, they will get a country role in the Discord server.
3. Players may have their registration denied if they are deemed to be too skilled for BGTS.
4. The Player Moderation Team formed within the GTS organisation can refuse a player from participating in the tournament, if the organisation deem such player's skill is much higher than the target rank range.
5. We are allowing 2 teams coming from a country under certain conditions:
   - There are **7 or more players** signed up for a country.
   - Each team has to have **at least 3 players**.
6. Because of the previous rule, there are going to be different scenarios when creating the teams:
   - If there are 5 players or less signed up for a country, those players will form the team representing their country.
   - In case there are more than 10 players signed up for a country, players will decide amnong themselves who will partake in the tournament. If they cannot decide the top 10 players, the staff will choose it sorted by ranking to form the 2 teams.
   - If there are 6 players, players will have to decide on the 5 players who will partake in the tournament. If they cannot decide the top 5 players, the staff will choose it sorted by ranking to form the team.
   - If there are between 7 and 10 players (after keeping the best ranked ones) signed up for a country, the players from that country will have a few days to decide how to split themselves between the 2 teams. It's recommended to come to an agreement as fast as possible to then decide on the captain and be able to schedule and prepare their matches rapidly.
   - In case the players can't come to an agreement, they will be ranked by pp (performance point) and put in the 2 teams with at least 3 members in each of them with the best ones in a first team and the lowest in the second.
   - The players wil decide on the captain of their team.
   - If the players can't agree or name a captain, the highest ranked player will be chosen by default.
7. The captain is going to be the one to reschedule a match if needed and will ensure that the team is ready for the matches.

### Stage regulations

1. There are six stages in the tournament: the Qualifiers, the Group Stage, the Quarterfinals, the Semifinals, the Finals, and the Grand Finals.
2. The team will be seeded with the average of their ranks on each map during the Qualifiers round in 4 seeds: Top seed, High seed, Mid seed, and Low seed. (The seeding process will be explained more precisely in the [qualifiers regulations](#qualifiers-regulations) section)
3. Teams will be drawn in **4 groups of 4 teams** during the live drawings which will happen on **Sunday, December 6th 2020**.
4. In the Group Stage, all teams from each group will face each other. The **best 2 teams** get our of their group.
5. Rankings of each group are determined by sorting the results of each team's performance in the following priority:
   1. Most matches won.
   2. Highest (number of beatmaps won - number of maps lost) score.
   3. Most beatmaps won.
   4. Winner of the match played previously between the tied teams.
6. In Group Stage, "Win by Default" will be treated as win by 5:0, +1.0 score difference ratio.
7. The winning conditions for each stage are listed below:
   - the Group Stage: Best-of-9 (First to 5 points)
   - the Quarterfinals: Best-of-11 (First to 6 points)
   - the Semifinals, the Finals, and the Grand Finals: Best-of-13 (First to 7 points)

### Qualifiers regulations

1. During this round, there will be multiple lobbies available at various hours.
2. A private match will be created and teams will be invited into the lobby when it's their time. Make sure to be available at this time.
3. There are no warmups.
4. Failed scores will count.
5. Only two players from a team will be playing per map. There is no limitation on player swapping.
6. Seedings will be done with the average rank of each team on each map.
7. Maps will be played twice in a row during the lobby. The best run will be taken into account for the ranking.
8. Only the best 32 teams will continue on to the Group Stage.

### Match regulations

1. A private lobby will be created 10 minutes before your match by a referee. Both team's captains will be invited into the room when it's match time. The referee or the captains will invite the other players into the room.
2. If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.
3. If less than the minimum required players attend, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes.
4. There is no penalty for not joining the room instantly after match time as long as it's within the postponed time.
5. If neither of both teams have the minimum required players after 10 minutes, it will count as a loss for both teams in Group Stage. In the double-elimination bracket, the highest seeded team will advance.
6. The match will be played as **TeamVs** and **ScoreV2** and the name of the room will be: "AGTS 2020: (Team Red) vs (Team Blue)".
7. Each team is allowed one warmup but it must be below **3:00**. Everyone is allowed in the room during warmups.
8. If a team takes more than 2 minutes to decide on a warmup the referee will be skipping it.
9. Each captain has to ban **one beatmap** from the mappool (apart from Tiebreaker). These beatmaps are not allowed to be picked by any team in the entire match.
10. The captain of each team will do `!roll` in the chat.
11. The team with the highest `!roll` **bans second and picks first**. The team with the lowest `!roll` **bans first and picks second**.
12. Each captain has 2 minutes to name their ban. If they fail to do so, the ban will be made with a `!roll`.
13. Beatmap selection will then alternate between each captain selecting a beatmap out of the mappool.
14. Captains may pick freely from any bracket.
15. Teams will have 2 minutes to pick a beatmap and 2 minutes to get ready. If a team didn't name their pick before the end of the timer, the map will be picked with a `!roll`.
16. Exchanging players during a match is allowed without limitations.
17. If a player disconnects between the beatmaps and the team cannot provide an exchange, the match can be delayed 10 minutes at most. This delay can only be applied once.
18. If a player disconnects, they get treated as if they failed the map.
19. Disconnects within 30 seconds after the beatmap was started allows the map to be replayed. This is only allowed once per team.
20. Failed players' scores don't get added to the team score.
21. If the beatmap ends in a draw, the game will be nullified and the map will be replayed.
22. In case of a tie in points (example: 4-4 in BO9) the tiebreaker will be played.
