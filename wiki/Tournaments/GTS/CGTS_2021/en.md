### General rules

1. This tournament is a two-parts tournament. The first part will be a 1v1 tournament within different regions. There will be 5 of these, all played at the same dates. The second part will be a 4v4 between the top 8 of each region.
2. The players/teams will first play a Qualifiers to seed them accordingly, then will head on to a double-elimination tournament.
3. The scoring system that will be used is **ScoreV2**.
4. Any members of staff apart from the **Hosts, Mappool Selectors, and Referees** are allowed to play.
5. Players and staff members must have read this ruleset entirely. (and we will assume everyone did so throughout the tournament)
