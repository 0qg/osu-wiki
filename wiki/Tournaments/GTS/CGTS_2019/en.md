### Scheduling instructions

### Match regulations

1. A private lobby will be created 10 minutes before your match by a referee. You will get invited by the referee either right then, or right at the match time. During the team tournament, both teams captains will be invited into the room when it's match time. Then the referees or the captains will invite the other players into the room.
2. If no staff or referee is available, the match will be postponed.
3. If less than the minimum required players attend, the maximum time the match can be postponed is 10 minutes. After then, it will be a WBD no matter what, unless if the players in the lobby do not mind waiting more time.
4. If neither of both teams have the minimum required players after 10 minutes, the highest seeded team will advance.
5. During the 1v1 tournament, matches will be played as Head to Head and Score V2. The name of the room will be "CGTS 2019: (Player 1) vs (Player 2)"

8. Each player/captain has to ban **one beatmap** to be selected from the pool (apart from Tiebreaker). These beatmaps are not allowed to be picked by any team in the entire match.

12. Players/Captains may pick freely from any bracket.
13. Players/Captains will have 2 minutes to ban and pick maps, and to get ready as well. If by the end of the timer no map is picked, the referee will `!roll` with the number of maps left in the pool, and the number he will fall on will be the pick.

19. If the beatmap ends in a draw, the game will be nullified and the map will be replayed. If a second tie happens, the map will be nullified, and the team picking this map will have to pick another map.
20. In case of a tie in points (example: 4-4 in BO9), the tiebreaker is selected.
