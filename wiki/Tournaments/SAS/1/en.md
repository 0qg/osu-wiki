## Ruleset

### General rules

1. Advanced Global Taiko Showdown is a **2v2 double-elimination tournament** with teams of **5 players maximum**.
2. The teams will first go through a **Qualifiers**. Then they will play in a **Group Stage** and finally play in a **double-elimination bracket**.
3. The scoring system that will be used is **ScoreV2**.
4. Any player who meets the requirements stated in the [rank restrictions](#rank-restrictions) section is allowed to sign up. Since AGTS will aim to get badged, some players might be declined by the osu! staff (via screening).
5. Any members of staff apart from **Organiser, Map selector (both general and All Stars), and Referees** are allowed to play.
6. Players and staff members must have read this ruleset entirely (and we will assume you did so throughout the tournament).
7. All participants must stay respectful and keep a proper attitude. Not following this rule can result in a ban/blacklist from the tournament. This rule concerns all the staff as well.
8. Any rule changes or unexpected occurences will be announced in the AGTS Discord server.

### Rank restrictions

1. Players must be within the rank of #500 - #3,500 during registrations. This means that they have to be in this rank range **until the end of registrations**.
2. Players are not allowed to rank up further than **#400 during the tournament**. If they pass the limit, they will be disqualified immediately.
3. Players must sign up with the country flag of their profile.
4. Players must join the Discord server of the tournament.

### Tournament registration and teams creation

1. In order to participate, players need to meet the criteria stated in the [rank restriction](#rank-restrictions) section.
2. Players sign up individually. When their registration is accepted, they will get a country role in the Discord server.
3. The staff can decline a player from participating in the tournament if the staff deem their skill is much higher than the targeted rank range.
4. This iteration, we are allowing 2 teams coming from a country under certain conditions:
   - There are **7 or more players** signed up for a country.
   - Each team has to have **at least 3 players**.
5. Because of the previous rule, there are going to be different scenarios when creating the teams:
   - If there are 5 players or less signed up for a country, those players will form the team representing their country.
   - In case there are more than 10 players signed up for a country, players will decide amnong themselves who will partake in the tournament. If they cannot decide the top 10 players, the staff will choose it sorted by ranking to form the 2 teams.
   - If there are 6 players, players will have to decide on the 5 players who will partake in the tournament. If they cannot decide the top 5 players, the staff will choose it sorted by ranking to form the team.
   - If there are players between 7 - 10 players (after keeping the best ranked ones) signed up for a country, the players from that country will have a few days to decide how to split themselves between the 2 teams. It's recommended to come to an agreement as fast as possible to then decide on the captain and be able to schedule and prepare their matches rapidly.
   - In case the players can't come to an agreement, they will be ranked by pp (performance point) and put in the 2 teams with at least 3 members in each of them with the best ones in a first team and the lowest in the second.
   - The players wil decide on the captain of their team.
   - If the players can't agree or name a captain, the highest ranked player will be chosen by default.
6. The captain is going to be the one to reschedule a match if needed and will ensure that the team is ready for the matches.

### Stage regulations

1. There are seven stages in the tournament: the Qualifiers, the Group Stage, the Round of 16, the Quarterfinals, the Semifinals, the Finals, and the Grand Finals.
2. The team will be seeded with the average of their ranks on each map during the Qualifiers round in 4 seeds: Top seed, High seed, Low seed, and Unseeded. (The seeding process will be explained more precisely in the [qualifiers regulations](#qualifiers-regulations) part)
3. Teams will be drawn in **8 groups of 4 teams** during the live drawings which will happen on **Sunday, September 17th 2020**.
4. In the Group Stage, all teams from each group will face each other. The **best 2 teams** get our of their group.
5. Rankings of each group are determined by sorting the results of each team's performance in the following priority:
   1. Most matches won.
   2. Highest (number of beatmaps won - number of maps lost) score.
   3. Most beatmaps won.
   4. Winner of the match played previously between the tied teams.
6. In Group Stage, "Win by Default" will be treated as win by 5:0, +1.0 score difference ratio.
