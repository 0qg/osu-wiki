## Ruleset

1. osu!mania LN Tournament 2 is a **1v1** osu!mania 4K tournament.
2. The score system used in this tournament will be **ScoreV2**.
3. There will be **no rank restrictions** to participate in the tournament.
4. In order for your registration to count, please refer to the following criteria:
   - Players have filled the [registration form](https://forms.gle/ektYSXGzZFXumVz59)
   - Players have to join the [o!mLN Discord server](#links) at least until the time they get eliminated.
5. All maps are played with FreeMod being ON. Mirror mod is **allowed** on all maps. Here is a list of mods players can also play with: Hidden, Fade-In, Flashlight, and any combination of those mods. Players are also allowed, but not forced, to play with NoFail.
6. Players will be seeded according to their average rank of each map played in the Qualifiers.
7. This tournament will adopt double-elimination bracket, as such the player coming from the loser's bracket will have to win 2 matches in order to win the tournament.
8. Anyone participating in this tournament (including staff) must have common decency, and not be overly toxic for no reason, otherwise a ban from the tournament will be enforced.
9. Only in the **first 20 seconds** of a map can the map be retried if anything hindering happens such as a disconnect. If anything happens after this, whether it's a disconnect or lags, the map will not be replayed.
10. If the beatmap ends in a draw, the beatmap has to be replayed again. If it ends in a draw on the second try, the beatmap will be nullified, and the player who picked it'll have to choose another map.
11. Failed scores will be counted.
12. Players will be allowed to ban **one map** from Round of 64 up until Quarterfinals (that includes the loser's bracket rounds played then), and **two maps** from Semifinals and onwards.
13. The player that rolls highest will pick first and ban second.
14. Ban alternation is used (Lower rolling player bans one map first, then the higher rolling player bans one map, then the lower rolling, then the higher rolling).
15. Always remember that this is just a game (eg. behave yourself while the match is ongoing).
16. If neither players show up to a match, the winner will be decided by who has the best seeding.
17. Following are winning conditions for each stage:
    - the Round of 64 and the Round of 32: Best-of-7 (First to 4 points)
    - the Round of 16 and the Quarterfinals: Best-of-9 (First to 5 points)
