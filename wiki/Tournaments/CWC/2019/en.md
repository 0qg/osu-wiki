### Tournament Registration

1. Every user interested in joining their country's team signs up individually.
   - Tournament Management will create a list of potential candidates for a country's team.
   - Tournament Management declares one candidate to the captain of the country's team, albeit temporarily.
   - The declared captain can form their team from the candidate list of their country.

   - Every registered user will be assigned to their respective country's candidate list.
   - To be successfully accepted on the list, you have to ensure that your global osu!catch performance ranking is above 5000.

4. Only the 32 potentially strongest countries will participate. The potential strength of a country is determined by the online statistics of all valid candidates.
   - If the amount of registered countries is below 32, the number might be reduced to 24, 20 or 16. The aim is always to let as many countries participate as possible!
5. Mapset selectors may not participate as a player in this tournament.

   - This may change depending on how many teams are accepted into the competition at the end.

3. Rankings of each group are determined by sorting the results of each team's performance in the following priority:

6. Based on [this image](https://puu.sh/bUq5V/f1066103b0.png), the stages are split up into the following:
