# Beats per minute

**Beats per minute**, abbreviated as ***BPM***, refers to the number of whole musical beats in a minute, and is used to measure the [tempo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo) of a song. Tempo and offset combined allows for snapping [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) to the timeline when creating [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). This ensures gameplay aligns with the beat. Setting the BPM is the second thing to be done when creating a new beatmapâ€”the first being [song setup](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Song_Setup). It can be changed later in the `Timing` tab of the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor), or by pressing `Ctrl` + `P`.

Most modern songs use a single BPM which requires a single timing point. More complex songs may require multiple timing points and timing resets to be timed correctly. Timing points are shown as red lines in the timeline at the bottom of the editor.

Inside the `Timing` tab of the editor, a BPM estimation tool can be found. This works by calculating a BPM and offset from the user tapping along with the song. This is useful for estimating a BPM value, but usually requires additional adjustment to be fully synced with the song.

BPM also influences other elements such as slider velocity in [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), and scroll speed in [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania).
