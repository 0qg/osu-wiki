# Beats per minute

**Beats Per Minute**, abbreviated as *BPM*, refers to the number of whole beats in a minute. BPM is used to measure the [tempo](wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo) of a song. This is needed to line up the beats of a song with the [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) of a [beatmap] successfully. It can be changed in the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor) under the `Timing` tab, or by using the shortcut (`Ctrl` + `P`).

Most modern songs use a single BPM which requires a single timing point. More complex songs may require multiple timing points and timing resets to adjust succesfully. Timing points are shown as red lines in the timeline at the bottom of the editor.

Inside the `Timing` tab of the editor, a BPM estimation tool can be found. This works by calculating a BPM and offset from the user tapping along with the song. This is useful for estimating a BPM value, but usually requires additional adjustment to be fully synced with the song.

BPM also influences other elements such as slider velocity in [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), and scroll speed in [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania).
