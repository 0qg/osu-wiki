# Sampleset

A **sampleset** is the collection of sound effects that are heard during gameplay.

There are **three** types of hitsounds:

- Normal
- Soft
- Drum

Of these types, there are **three** different hitsound additions that are played over the default *normal* hitsound:

- whistle
- finish
- clap

A *normal* hitsound is used by default when working with any of these **samplesets**. This is the default sound you will hear when objects are clicked.

Other parts of a sampleset may include the slider tick sounds and the sound made when filling the spinner metre.
