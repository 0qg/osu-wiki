# Song Compilation

A **song compilation** is a collection of songs usually sharing a genre or artist-related theme.

For [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps), a song compilation often refers to a beatmap's audio file that features multiple different songs. This is not to be confused with a beatmapset that includes multiple song files in its folder.
