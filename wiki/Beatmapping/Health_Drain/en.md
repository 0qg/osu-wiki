# Health drain

Health drain refers to the natural drain of the health bar that occurs when playing a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps), disregarding the influence of any [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects). This drain is dependent on the HP difficulty setting, which is set by the mapper of a beatmap. This value ranges from 0 to 10, where 10 is the highest and most punishing setting and 0 is the most forgiving. The HP difficulty setting can be changed alongside other difficulty settings in the [Beatmap Editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor). Doing this will change a Ranked beatmap's status to unranked and will erase all local scores on it.

osu!standard and osu!catch have health drain at a constant rate throughout the course of a beatmap, with the exception of breaks. As for osu!taiko and osu!mania, health drain is disabled, so only the hit objects will affect the health bar.
