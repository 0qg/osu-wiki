# Health drain

Health drain refers to the natural drain of the health bar that occurs when a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) is played without the influence of any [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects). This drain is dependent on the HP difficulty setting, which can only be set by the mapper of a beatmap.

osu!standard and osu!catch will have health drain at a constant rate throughout the course of a beatmap, with the exception of breaks. As for osu!taiko and osu!mania, health drain is disabled, so only the hit objects will affect the health bar.
