# Combo Colour

*(To see regulations surrounding combo colours see the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).)*

Combo colours are colours that are used to group [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) together into combosets, according to musical representation. Combo colouring is an important aspect to a beatmap's aesthetic value. New combos are most commonly done according to verses, measures, vocal phrases and/or instrument scripts. A generally acceptable combo length is 5-20 notes, but less can also work under the right circumstances. Combo colours can be set in the Song Setup panel. A beatmap can have a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8 combo colours.

In osu!standard, all combosets have a colour. A new combo is started when the colour of the hit objects changes. The colours will keep repeating themselves depending on how many colours a mapper defined in the [Song Setup](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Song_Setup) panel (or how many colours your skin's `skin.ini` file defines).

In osu!catch, each fruit is coloured in the order given. Droplets and end-slider fruit will always have the same colour as the start-fruit. However, bananas will always have a tint of yellow.

For skins, the skin properties for combo colours is located in the `[Colours]` section of the `skin.ini`. However, do note that the skin's defined combo colours is only used when the beatmapper does **not** define them.

## Colourhaxing

Colourhaxing is the act of picking each individual new combo's colour. This allows for full control over combo colours and can be used to make different sections of a beatmap stand out. A very common way of doing this is to have the Kiai use brighter combo colours than other sections to make it stand out even more. Colourhaxing can be a very tedious process, as new combos are defined through references to the earlier new combo. This means that changing one combo will change all following combos as well.
