# Combo Colour

*(See the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) for regulations surrounding combo colours.)*

Combo colours are colours that are used to group [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) into combosets, according to musical representation. Combo colouring is an important aspect to a beatmap's aesthetic value, as it is one of the only ways to change the visuals of a beatmap besides [storyboards](/wiki/Storyboard_Scripting). New combos are most commonly done according to verses, measures, vocal phrases and/or instrument scripts. A generally acceptable combo length is 5-20 notes, but less can also work under the right circumstances. Combo colours can be set in the Song Setup panel. A beatmap can have a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8 combo colours.

In osu!standard, all combosets have a colour. A new combo is started when the colour of hit objects change. Colours will keep repeating themselves depending on the amount defined by a beatmapper in the [Song Setup](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Song_Setup) panel (or how many colours your skin's `skin.ini` file defines).

In osu!catch, each fruit is coloured in the order given. Droplets and end-slider fruit will always have the same colour as the start-fruit. However, bananas will always have a tint of yellow.

For skins, the skin properties for combo colours is located in the `[Colours]` section of the `skin.ini`. However, do note that the skin's defined combo colours is only used when the beatmapper does **not** define them.

## Colourhaxing

Colourhaxing is the act of picking each individual new combo's colour, instead of having the editor cycle through them. This allows for full control over combo colours, and can be used to make different sections of a beatmap stand out. A very common way of doing this is to have the Kiai use brighter combo colours than other sections to make it stand out even more. Colourhaxing can be a very tedious process, as new combos are defined through references to earlier combos. This means that changing one combo will change all the following combos as well.
