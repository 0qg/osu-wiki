# Combo

*Not to be confused with [Score Multiplier](/wiki/Score).*

Combos refer to groupings of [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) done according to musical representation. Groupings are most commonly done according to verses, measures, vocal phrases and/or instrument scripts. Different combos are separated by **New Combos**, or ***NCs***. New combos are made with the `New Combo` button (or the shortcut `Q`) on the right of the `Design` tab in the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor). How combos are displayed in gameplay depends on the currently enabled [gamemode](/wiki/Game_Modes).

## Combo colour

*For regulations surrounding combo colours, see: [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)*

When a new combo is started, the current combo colour changes. Combo colours are colours defined by a beatmapper, and apply to all hit objects in a beatmap. Combo colouring is an important aspect to a beatmap's aesthetic value, as it is one of the only ways to change the visuals of a beatmap besides [storyboarding](/wiki/Storyboard_Scripting) and [skinning](/wiki/Skinning). Combo colours can be set in the [Song Setup](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Song_Setup) panel, with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8 combo colours. Combo colours defined in a skin will only be used when a beatmapper does **not** define any combo colours, or when the player overrides it in their settings.

## Mode specific

In [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), each hit object in a combo has its own hitcircle number, as well as a combo colour. The combo colour is changed when a `New Combo` is started. Colours will keep repeating themselves depending on the amount defined by a beatmapper or how many colours your skin's `skin.ini` file defines. More health is recovered with [Geki and Katu](/wiki/Score/#osu) hit scores, which can be given from the last hit object in a combo. In [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch), hit objects do not have hitcircle numbers but each fruit is coloured in the order given. Droplets and end-slider fruit will always have the same colour as the start-fruit, however bananas will always have a tint of yellow. The length of combos can affect the difficulty of the map, as well as the amount of fruits that will be stacked on the catcher's plate. [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania) and [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko) do not use combos.

## Colourhaxing

Colourhaxing is the act of picking each individual new combo's colour, instead of having the editor cycle through them. This allows for full control over combo colours, and can be used to make different sections of a beatmap stand out. A very common way of doing this is to have the [kiai](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Kiai_Time) use brighter combo colours than other sections to make it stand out even more. Colourhaxing can be a very tedious process, as new combos are defined through references to earlier combos. This means that changing one combo will change all the following combos as well.
