# HP

*For Health as a gameplay mechanic, see: [Health](/wiki/Beatmapping/Health)*

*For regulations surrounding HP, see: [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)*

**HP** or *health*, is a difficulty setting which controls how heavily a player is penalized for missing notes and how much [health](/wiki/Beatmapping/Health) is gained back by accurately hitting [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects).

HP ranges from 0 to 10 where 10 is the highest and most punishing while 0 is the most lenient. On HP10, health drains rapidly and a single miss may be enough to fail a player. On HP0, multiple combos can be missed before the player fails.

The HP difficulty setting can be changed in the [Beatmap Editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor) alongside other difficulty settings.
