# Health drain

**Health drain**, or *HP drain*, refers to the natural drain of the health bar that occurs when playing a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). Health drain is dependent on the [HP](/wiki/Beatmapping/Health_drain) difficulty setting.

Health drain is only active in [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!) and [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch) beatmaps. It also does not take effect before the start of gameplay and during breaks.
