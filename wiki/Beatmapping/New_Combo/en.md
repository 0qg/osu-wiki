# New combo

*Main page: [Combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo)*

*Not to be confused with [Nightcore](/wiki/Game_Modifiers/Nightcore).*

**New combos** (more commonly known as *NCs*) signal the start of a new [combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo). How new combos behave during gameplay depends on the currently selected [game mode](/wiki/Game_Modes). They can be selected while [beatmapping](/wiki/Beatmapping) in the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor) by clicking the `New Combo` button on the right side of the `Compose` tab, or by using the shortcut `Q`. New combos are an integral part to colourhaxing.

## osu!standard

In [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), each [hit object](/wiki/Hit_object) has its own combo number and combo colour. When a new combo is started, the combo colour changes and the combo number resets to 1. This counts up for each following object.

*Note: Spinners force the next hit object to start a new combo.*

## osu!catch

In [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch), each type of fruit is coloured by the currently selected combo colour. When a new combo is started, the combo colour changes. Unlike osu!standard, fruits do not have a combo number.

## Other game modes

[osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko) and [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania) do not use new combos.
