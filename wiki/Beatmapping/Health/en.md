# Health

Health or more commonly known as *HP*, is the value that decides if a player has failed or passed a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). Health can be seen in the health bar which updates as a beatmap progresses. Health is largely determined by the HP difficulty setting, which is set by the mapper of a beatmap.

The HP difficulty settting controls how heavily a player is penalized for missing notes and how much health is gained back by accurately hitting [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects). HP values range from HP0 to HP10, where HP10 is the highest and most punishing setting and HP0 the most forgiving. On HP10 the health drains rapidly and a single miss may be enough to fail a player, whereas on HP0 multiple combos can be missed before failing a player. The HP difficulty setting can be changed alongside other difficulty settings in the [Beatmap Editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor). Doing this will change a Ranked beatmap's status to unranked and will erase all local scores on it.

## Health drain

A common system across game modes is known as health drain, which refers to the natural drain of the health bar that occurs when playing a beatmap. This value is also known as *HP drain*. Health drain is dependent on the HP difficulty setting. Health drain does not take effect before the start of gameplay and during breaks.

## osu!standard

In osu!standard health will decrease at a steady rate (health drain), but can be replenished by tapping notes at the right time or spinning spinners. Score bursts will appear after tapping hit circles, changing score and health values depending on the accuracy of the hit. A perfectly timed hit (300) will recover health more than a badly timed hit (50). Players also receive larger boosts if they achieve a [katu](#katu) or a [geki](#geki) at the end of a combo. A miss will drain health instead. If spinners are cleared early, continuing to spin will gain additional health back. For an overview of health recovery and health loss see below:

Health recovery:

- A successful tap on the hit circle (better judgement leads to more health gain; the last hit circle in a colour combo awards more health).
- A successful tap on a slider start.
- The slider ball collected a slider tick successfully.
- The slider ball touched the slider end or a reverse arrow successfully (better judgement at the end tick leads to more health gain).
- Completing a spinner and continuous spinning in the spinner duration (better judgement at the end of the spinner leads to more health gain).

Health loss:

- Health drain.
- Missing a hit circle.
- Tapping a slider head early.
- Missing a slider tick, or slider reverse arrow.
- Failed to achieve at least a 50 on a spinner.

Health reserved:

- Break time.

## osu!taiko

In osu!taiko the health bar starts off empty and must be filled up to at least 50% to achieve a pass on a difficulty. This is done through hitting hit objects in sync with the beat. Score bursts will appear after hitting notes, changing score and health values depending on the accuracy of the hit. A perfectly timed hit (300) will recover health more than a badly timed hit (50). A miss will drain health instead. Failing to complete a denden will result in health loss. Drumrolls can be ignored with no health penalty, as they have no influence on the health bar. Passive health drain is disabled in osu!taiko, so only hit objects affect the health bar. For an overview of health recovery and health loss see below:

Health recovery:

- Getting 'Great' or 'Good' on small/large notes.

Health loss:

- Getting 'Miss' or 'Bad' on small/large notes.
- Not completing Dendens.
- Not completing Shakers.

No effect:

- Doing drumrolls.
- Ignoring drumrolls.
- Completing Dendens.
- Completing Shakers.

_(Note: It is entirely possible for a beatmap to never pass by design due to it only containing drumrolls and/or dendens/shakers.)_

## osu!catch

In osu!catch health will decrease at a steady rate (health drain), but can be replenished by catching fruit and drops. Score bursts will appear after catching fruit, changing score and health values depending on the accuracy of the hit. The player also receives larger boosts if he catches the end of a combo resulting in a [geki](#geki). Missing fruit will drain health instead. Bananas can be ignored with no health penalty. For an overview of health recovery and health loss see below:

Health recovery:

- Collecting any fruits, juice drops, or bananas.

Health loss:

- Constant life drain.
- Not collecting any fruits or juice drops.

Health reserved:

- None.

## osu!mania

In osu!mania passive health drain is disabled, so only hit objects will affect the health bar. Score bursts will appear after hitting notes, changing score and health values depending on the accuracy of the hit. A perfectly timed hit (300) will recover health more than a badly timed hit (50). Players also receive larger boosts if they achieve a [katu](#katu) or a [geki](#geki) at the end of a combo. A miss will drain health instead. Health bar regeneration occurs slowly while holding hold notes. For an overview of health recovery and health loss see below:

Health recovery:

- Getting Rainbow 300, 300, or 200.
- Holding the hold note with correct key.

Health loss:

- Getting 50 or Miss.

Health reserved:

- None.
