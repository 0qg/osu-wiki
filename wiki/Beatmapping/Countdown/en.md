# Countdown

*For tournament timers, see: [Tournament management commands](/wiki/osu!tourney/Tournament_Management_Commands)*

*For regulations around countdowns, see: [Ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)*

A countdown may appear in the beginning of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). This is useful for songs that go directly into the heat of things. Most maps do not need this option enabled. The option can be disabled in the [song setup](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Song_Setup) menu, under the "Design" tab. Countdowns are not allowed in osu!taiko.

When enabled, the countdown animation can be controlled using the `Countdown Speed` buttons (`Half`, `Normal`, `Double`) and the `Countdown Offset` button. `Countdown Speed` buttons halve, double or keep the standard speed of the countdown animation. `Countdown Offset` sets the offset in beats before the first hit object. For example, a countdown with offset 2 has its animation start 2 beats earlier than normal. For maps with intros, skipping goes directly to the countdown.

The countdown animation can be [skinned](/wiki/Skinning).
