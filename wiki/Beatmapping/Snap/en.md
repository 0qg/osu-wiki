# Snap

**Snap** refers to a [hit object](/wiki/Hit_objects) automatically "snapping" to a tick in the [hit objects timeline](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timelines#hit-objects). Changing the [beat snap divisor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Beat_Snap_Divisor) allows hit objects to snap to different timeline ticks.
