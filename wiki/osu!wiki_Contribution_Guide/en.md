# osu!wiki Contribution Guide

Thanks for your interest in making the osu!wiki better! At this time, contributing to the osu!wiki will require more time and slightly more effort to make your changes actually happen. This quick-start guide is intended for newcomers that have never worked with GitHub and the wiki contribution workflow before. If you already have experience using GitHub, feel free to skip this guide and follow the common feature-branch workflow for content updates in this repository.

## Signing up

First, if you don't have a GitHub account, sign up for one. See [Signing up for a new GitHub account - User Documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) for help. Then log in (you will need to verify your email).

## Forking

To make changes, you will need to fork the `osu-wiki` repository.

## Guides

From this point, you have two choices, edit using GitHub's web interface (online) or locally.

- [Online](/wiki/owcg/Online), best for single article edits (this includes uploading, deleting, and moving images or files)
- [Locally](/wiki/owcg/Locally), best for multi-article edits
