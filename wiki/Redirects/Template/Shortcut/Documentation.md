peppy has added support for wiki links in in-game chat. But there is a problem. Nobody will use long article names in chat. Try to type [Catch the Beat Ranking Criteria](Catch_the_Beat_Ranking_Criteria "wikilink"). Pfft. That's why we need this template.

How to use it:

-   You create a redirect to target article (e. g. [CtBRC](CtBRC "wikilink")) with following text:

`#REDIRECT [[Catch the Beat Ranking Criteria]]`
`[[Category:Short_Links]]`

-   Then you go to that article and put this template with short link: .

-   You will see this, so everyone will know they can use this shortcut `----->>`
-   yay!

You can spell up to 10 alternative short links in one template.
