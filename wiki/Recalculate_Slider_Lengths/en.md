# Recalculate slider lengths

**Recalculate slider lengths** is a command under the `Timing` tab in the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor). Usage of this is suggested after a BPM change is made, if the [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) already has [sliders](/wiki/Hit_object/Slider).

This command will automatically adjust the length of every slider in the beatmap to the new BPM. It is important to check every slider and adjust its length manually, since this tool isn't fully accurate.
