# Restricted Mode

A restriction is a timeout from the community forced upon accounts that exhibit abnormal, suspicious, or rule-breaking behaviour.

When an account is restricted, it is unable to interact with the community until the restriction is lifted. Restricted players can still continue playing and submitting scores, but their profile will be invisible to others.

The following features are disabled for restricted accounts:
- in-game chat
- private messaging on the forums
- posting on forums
- updating maps or profile details
- store purchases

## My account has been restricted! What do I do?

If your account has been restricted, do not panic. Please follow these steps:
- **Wait 24 hours.** Some restrictions are the results of automated processes. As we check every new restriction daily, please wait 24 hours - if your restriction was erroneous, it will be lifted within that time.
- **Contact our support team.** If your account remains restricted after that time, please send an email to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) to ask about the reasons for it. We'll need at the very least to know your username to be able to check! Remember to send the email from the email address attached to your account so that we can confirm you are the owner.

In the cases where an account becomes restricted for breaking the [rules](/wiki/rules), a cooldown of three months (strictly) will be given before the user is allowed to send an appeal. If the account you asked about is not your first, please check if your original account is restricted or not. If it isn't, you can continue playing on it, but make sure you do not continue accessing your multi-accounts as that might lead to further punishments.

If you have recently been granted an appeal and your account has become restricted again after a play, don't panic. This is something that happens to some appeal returnees. The support team will generally remove those restrictions within 24 hours. Feel free to send us an email or a tweet to catch our attention and be unrestricted faster!

## Why am I restricted?

There aren't that many reasons why an account might be restricted.
- **It isn't your first account.** Multi-accounting is against the rules. Any accounts other than a person's first will become permanently restricted, but their original one will in most cases be left open and the user is encouraged to continue playing on it. If the multi-accounting is severe or abusive, a silence may be applied to their original account as a warning to cease creating new ones, and a restriction will be placed on the main account if the multi-accounting behaviour continues. If your account is restricted and you know you own other ones, please do not continue accessing the restricted accounts you have and stick to playing on your original one. If you have trouble accessing or verifying it, please send us an email at [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) so that we can help you recover access to it.
- **You've allowed someone to play on your account.** Account sharing is also against the rules. If you've let someone use your account, it will be restricted, and the person who used it will likely receive a silence or be restricted themselves. If this happened accidentally, please let us know as soon as possible by sending an email to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh).
- **You cheated.** Using a third-party program, macros, or any form of unfair advantage will result in an immediate restriction.
- **Other cases.** The accounts team reserves the right to restrict an account for cases that aren't covered by the three above. This generally includes investigating allegations of cheating or punishing excessive bad behaviour on the forums or chats.

## What do I do while on cooldown before appealing?
- **Keep enjoying the game!** While your account is restricted and you are on cooldown, you are more than welcome to continue playing the game (as long as you play on your original account!). The scores you achieve while restricted will be submitted, and unless your account is rolled back, they will remain after you become unrestricted.
- **Maintain good behaviour.** We understand that being restricted can be frustrating, but think of it as a chance to take some time off, away from the game and community. Try to avoid interacting with the community at least for a few days (whether it be via discord or social media) to cool down and reflect on the actions that may have contributed to your account being restricted. Raging at others, spamming the support team, or insulting the staff is not going to help in making you unrestricted.
- **Make sure you do respect the rules.** Restrictions are punishments for breaking the rules. If you continue doing so while restricted, the cooldown before you can appeal will be reset. This includes continuing to cheat, or creating or accessing new accounts to evade the restriction.
- **Follow the support team's instructions.** The three-month cooldown imposed on accounts is a chance to take time off and reflect on your actions. If you attempt appealing before that time, or continue trying to contact the support team to shorten the cooldown, you will be ignored.  If you're unsure when your cooldown expires, when you will be allowed to appeal, or which of your accounts you should be playing on and appealing for, you are welcome to send us an email to ask. Just make sure not to send any appeals before the date given to you!
- **Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.** As long as you're not trying to circumvent punishment or shorten the cooldown, we will happily answer any questions you have about your account's restriction!

# Three months have passed. How do I appeal?

You can appeal by sending an email to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh). Again, we'll need your username, and make sure that you are sending it from the email address attached to your account! After you send your appeal, expect a reply within one week. If you haven't received one then, please contact us on twitter or by email - there is a chance we have not received it or closed it by accident!

When trying to appeal, you are free to write what you want in your message! We do however have expectations for what the appeal should include. Appeals don't have to be full-length essays - as long as you are honest and genuine, your appeal will be sufficient. We're looking to make sure you know what you were restricted for and you are aware of what rules you've broken. There is no point in unrestricting a user who will continue breaking the rules after being unrestricted.

We expect the following points in appeals:
- **Account history.** It doesn't need to be too detailed. This should include all your breaches of the major rules (multi-accounting, account sharing, cheating, or major silences). You don't need to remember every date, every silence, or every account you've created, as long as you are honest with what you did. This includes any rules you've broken while restricted if you did.
- **Why you broke the rules.** An explanation as to what led you to decide to create new accounts, give your account away, cheat, or others, will help us (and you) determine whether or not you are at risk of offending again. If you continued offending while restricted, we'll also be interested in knowing why.
- **How you obtained the means to do so.** This applies mostly to cheating - we want to know where you obtained the tool you used, how you came across it, and whether or not it is still present on your computer.
- **Why we should allow you back.** Most of the time, this ties in to the second point. We just want to ensure that you won't be breaking the rules again! Please understand that the heavier your account's history, the more we will expect from this section.

## My appeal has been denied!

There are only a few reasons why an appeal gets denied.
- **It was sent too early.** If the cooldown for your account has not yet passed, your appeal will be denied. If you're unsure when you can actually appeal, please reply to our answer - we'll give you the correct date.
- **Your appeal was insufficient or incomplete.** If your appeal does not cover the four points listed above, we will request that you write a more proper one. This **does not** reset the cooldown for your account and you are free to send your new appeal at any point in time! If you attempted lying or hiding parts of your history (mainly multi-accounting or cheating), your appeal will be denied for being non-truthful and your cooldown reset to three months. This is another chance for you to reflect on your actions and make sure you did not forget anything.
- **You have been evading or playing on other accounts.** Creating another account to be able to play online while your account is restricted is an attempt at evading the restriction and will reset your cooldown to three months from the date you created the account. If you attempt evading too many times, we might permanently deny the appeal. If you are still accessing your multi-accounts while restricted, your cooldown will also be reset. Remember that multi-accounting is against the [rules](/wiki/rules) and you are expected to only play on your original account. If you're unsure which account you should be playing on, send us an email and we'll tell you!
- **You continued offending while restricted.** Why would we unrestrict someone who's still breaking the rules after having been restricted? If you do continue offending, the cooldown for your account will be reset to your last offence. If this happens too much, your appeal will be permanently denied.
- **Your history is too severe.** In cases of extreme offenders, or people who get restricted again after already being back on appeal, we might simply state that your history is too severe to rejoin the game at the current time. In those cases, we recommend to wait **a long time** before appealing again, and making sure you do not continue breaking the rules.
