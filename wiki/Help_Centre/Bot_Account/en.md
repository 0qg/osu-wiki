# Bot Account criteria

Some users have been creating "chat bots" with various functionalities offered to the community via multiplayer lobbies or PM converstions. This is generally permitted as long as it is in good taste.

If you are looking to start a similar service, please begin by running it on your own osu! account. As it grows, there may be an opportunity to request an account specifically for the bot to live on.

**Do not create a bot account before checking with us first. This will be considered multi-accounting and be punished.**

## Benefits of a bot account

Running the bot on one's account runs the risk of getting the user silenced. Messages are rate-limited and exceeding those rates will lead to automated silences from BanchoBot.

Regular accounts have the following rates:
- 5 public messages every 4 seconds
- 10 private messages every 5 seconds

Accounts marked as bots have the following rates:
- 60 public messages every 60 seconds
- 300 private messages every 60 seconds

We do not increase rate limits on personal accounts - this will only be done on the bot account if the request is approved.

## Criteria for applying for a bot account

Before considering a request, we require that the bot created by a user follow these criteria:

- The bot has been run on the user's account for at least 6 months
- The bot must be fully open source and have full public documentation
- The bot must be used by at least 50 unique users every month
- The bot must respect the rate limits (on regular accounts at first)
- **The bot must not send any messages in non-multiplayer public channels.** All bot interaction must be done in private messages.
- The bot must be of use by the community. Personal bots will not be granted their own accounts.

## Applying for a bot account

If your bot fulfills the criteria above, you can file a request to create an account specifically for it.

Send an email to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) with "Bot Account Request: nameofyourbot" in the title. This must be sent from the email address attached to your account.

The body of the email should contain the following:
- The username you want to give to the account
- Date on which you began running the bot
- A link to the source code and documentation
- A short summary of what your bot does and its functionalities

We will review the request and decide whether or not to grant you permission to create an account for the bot. If your request is denied, we will let you know why.

## Bot Account Creation

If your request is approved, we will create the account for you and give you follow-up instructions.

**The bot account must never have any plays submitted on it.** If we catch a bot account being played on, it will be immediately terminated.
