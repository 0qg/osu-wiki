# Ranking

**Ranking** (alternatively called "leaderboards") is a list that sorts members of the osu! community according to certain criteria. This can also refer to one's position in such a list.

All but the individual beatmap rankings can be navigated to by hovering the `rankings` menu on the website header. For the individual beatmap ranking, they can be found on their beatmap info page.

## Performance points ranking

*Main page: [Performance points](/wiki/Performance_points)*

The performance points ranking describes a player's skill-level in comparison to other players. This leaderboard is determined by the total number of performance points an individual player has, and can be seen on a player's profile and on the [performance leaderboards](https://osu.ppy.sh/rankings/osu/performance).

## Score ranking

The score ranking compares players' total score and lists them accordingly. Ranking highly on this leaderboard requires a large time commitment, but requires relatively less mechanical skill than the performance points ranking.

## kudosu! ranking

The kudosu! ranking compares users' accumulated [kudosu!](/wiki/Modding/Kudosu) and lists them accordingly. This ranking requires no playing skill as kudosu! is gained as part of the [modding process](/wiki/Modding).

## Spotlights ranking

The Spotlights rankings are time-limited leaderboards that compare players' skill on a specific set of beatmaps each [Spotlights](/wiki/Beatmap_Spotlights) season. Players who rank highly on Spotlights rankings will receive specific awards as a result of their hard work.

## Beatmap ranking

The beatmap rankings compare players' scores against each other on individual beatmaps. They appear once a beatmap has been [Qualified](/wiki/Beatmaps#qualified), [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmaps#ranked), [Approved](/wiki/Beatmaps#approved), or Loved. The top eight are shown without having to scroll, and if the player has a top 50 score, it will automatically scroll to their score. First place ranks can be seen on a user's profile page.

## Country ranking

The country rankings are based on performance points of players from a country.
