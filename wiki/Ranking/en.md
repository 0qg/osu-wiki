# Ranking

**Ranking**, alternatively called *leaderboards*, is a list that sorts members of the osu! community according to certain criteria. This can also refer to one's position in such a list.

osu! currently has five types of rankings:

- Performance point ranking: based on [performance points](/wiki/Performance_Points).
- Score ranking: based on total ranked score.
- Kudosu! ranking: based on [kudosu!](/wiki/Modding/Kudosu) count.
- Spotlights rankings: based on [score](/wiki/Score) on the currently spotlighted beatmaps.
- Beatmap rankings: based on score for individual [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps).
- Country rankings: based on performance points of players from a country.

The performance point ranking, score ranking, and Kudosu! ranking can be navigated to by using the `Rankings` dropdown panel at the top of the webpage and choosing the `Performance` option.

## Performance point ranking

Performance point ranking describes a player's skill-level in comparison to other players. This leaderboard is determined by performance points, and can be seen on a player's profile and on the [performance leaderboards](https://osu.ppy.sh/rankings/osu/performance).

## Score ranking

Score ranking compares players' total score and lists them accordingly. Ranking highly on this leaderboard requires a large time commitment, but requires relatively less mechanical skill than the performance point ranking.

## Kudosu! ranking

Kudosu! ranking compares users' accumulated Kudosu and lists them accordingly. This ranking requires no playing skill as Kudosu! is gained as part of the [modding process](/wiki/Modding).

## Spotlights rankings

Spotlights rankings are time-limited leaderboards that compare players' skill on a specific set of beatmaps each spotlight season. Players who rank highly on spotlight rankings receive rewards.

## Beatmap rankings

Beatmap rankings compare players' scores against eachother on individual beatmaps. They appear once a beatmap has been Qualified, Ranked, Approved or Loved.  First place rankings on these leaderboards can be seen on a user's profile page, and comes with a bit of prestige.
