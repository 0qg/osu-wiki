# Katu

*See also: [Geki](/wiki/Geki)*

*Not to be confused with osu!taiko's Katu*

**Katu (Âñù)**, *Katsu*, or *Beat!*, is a [scoring](/wiki/Score) term used when a player has completed a comboset without achieving the highest possible [accuracy](/wiki/Gameplay/Accuracy) on every note.
However, Katu can't be achieved if a combo contains a 50 or a miss.

There are two types of Katu, which depend on the result of the last hit in a combo. The first type is worth 300 base score points, and the second one is worth 100 base score points. The 100-point Katu gives the least amount of HP, and 300-point Katu gives less HP than a [Geki](/wiki/Geki).

This idea originates from the Nintendo DS game [Elite Beat Agents](/wiki/iNiS_games), which [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!)'s gameplay is based on.

## Screenshots

In here provided the screenshots of obtaining a Katu/Katsu/Beat from Elite Beat Agents, Ouendan 2, and osu! itself.

## Other game modes

### osu!taiko

Katu is the judgement given when a player hits big notes perfectly by pressing two keys of the same colour simultaneously. osu!taiko has more leniency on handling both health bonus and score bonus for hitting both keys within short timespan.

### osu!catch

Katu is counted for every droplet the player failed to catch. This value is not shown on the results screen.

### osu!mania

On osu!mania, Katu is shown as a 200. As the value states, it gives 200 worth of score with slight penalty on the accuracy side.

## Other game aspects

### Storyboard (DS Games)

Katu triggers the second-tier on the storyboard during the gameplay, which usually shows a natural spirit during the sequence.

### Storyboard (osu!)

Storyboards in osu! are mostly intended for osu!standard. Obtaining Katu makes several events occur:

- [Fail Layer](/wiki/Storyboard_Scripting/General_Rules#layers) is deactivated.
- [Pass Layer](/wiki/Storyboard_Scripting/General_Rules#layers) is activated.
- "Passing" event is triggered, if the previous state was Fail.

To note that Fail side of storyboard in osu! is different than DS Games.
