# Geki

*See also: [Katu](/wiki/Katu)*

**Geki (æ¿€)**, or *Elite Beat!*, is a [scoring](/wiki/Score) term used when a player has completed a comboset with the highest possible [accuracy](/wiki/Gameplay/Accuracy) on every note.

Geki gives a higher HP gain, compared to a combo ending with a non-Geki 300s.

This idea originates from the Nintendo DS game [Elite Beat Agents](/wiki/iNiS_games), which [osu!](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!)'s gameplay is based on.

## Screenshots

In here provided the screenshots of obtaining a Geki/Elite Beat from Elite Beat Agents, Ouendan 2, and osu! itself.

## Other game modes

### osu!taiko

Geki is only shown on result screen to show all big note hitting succession.

### osu!catch

Geki shows that the player completed the combo without breaking it.

### osu!mania

Geki is shown as a sprite with rainbow-coloured `MAX` written over it. During the score calculation process, it is worth 320 points instead of 300. There's no accuracy difference between a 300 and a MAX in osu!mania.

## Other game aspects

### Storyboard (DS Games)

Geki triggers the best tier on the storyboard during the gameplay, which usually shows a very strong spirit during the sequence.

### Storyboard (osu!)

Storyboards in osu! are mostly intended for osu!standard. Obtaining Geki makes several events occur:

- [Fail Layer](/wiki/Storyboard_Scripting/General_Rules#layers) is deactivated.
- [Pass Layer](/wiki/Storyboard_Scripting/General_Rules#layers) is activated.
- "Passing" event is triggered, if the previous state was Fail.
