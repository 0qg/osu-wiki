# Geki

*See also: [Katu](/wiki/Katu)*

**Geki (æ¿€)**, or *Elite Beat!*, is a [scoring](/wiki/Score) term used when a player has completed a comboset with the highest possible [accuracy](/wiki/Gameplay/Accuracy) on every note.

By obtaining a Geki, health bar gain bonus obtained is stronger than just ending a comboset with a non-Geki 300s.

This idea originates from the Nintendo DS game Elite Beat Agents in which the [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!) [game mode](/wiki/Game_mode) is based on.

## Screenshots

In here provided the screenshots of obtaining a Geki/Elite Beat from Elite Beat Agents, Ouendan 2, and osu! itself.

## On other game modes

### osu!taiko

This is only shown on result screen to show all big note hitting succession.

### osu!catch

This shows that the completed the comboset without breaking any single combo.

### osu!mania

This is to determine a **MAX** or a "320", as the mode calculates this judgment as the base of maximum score instead a 300 itself.
There's no accuracy difference between a 300 and a MAX in osu!mania, therefore this judgment gives extra score with same accuracy.

## Other game aspects

### Storyboard (DS Games)

This triggers the best tier on the storyboard during the gameplay. Usually shown with very strong spirit shown during the sequence.

### Storyboard (osu!)

Storyboard in osu! mostly intended for osu!standard mode.
Obtaining Geki make several events occurs:

- Fail Layer deactivates.
- Pass Layer activates.
- Triggers "Passing" handler if transitioning from Fail state.
