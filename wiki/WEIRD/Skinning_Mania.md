[osu!mania](osu!mania "wikilink")
=================================

osu!mania allows a more freely customisation for the stage, its images, and its naming scheme.
This can be accomplished by assigning images via the **[Skin.ini](Skin.ini#.5BMania.5D "wikilink")-file.** You can alter the appearance of **one or more** specific column without touching the others, while all other columns are filled up with the default settings.
For example: **mania-keyT.png** can be assigned in the first column using **KeyImage0: mania-keyT** while the rest of the keys are filled with mania-key1.png,
mania-key2.png, or mania-keyS.png whenever possible.
Accompanied by being able to set paths in the commands you can even variate in designs for individual keycounts. The drawback of using the pathing method is that you have to assign the images to **EVERY** column (depending on your keycount up to 18 columns), for every key state, and every note sprite.
The tables below show all the **default images.** These will be used if you don't assign an image manually.
