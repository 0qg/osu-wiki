# ppv2

**ppv2** is the current implementation of [performance points](/wiki/Performance_Points), and aims to represent how difficult it is to achieve a given play on a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). It was originally implemented by [Tom94](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1857058), but has been further improved by users on the [osu!dev Discord server](/wiki/osu!dev_Discord_server) since then.

<!--TODO: Link a lot of stuff and add formulas for the algorithm itself-->
