# Total performance points

The **total performance points**-value determines a player's [ranking](/wiki/Ranking) compared to others. It is calculated based on their achieved scores, the [ppv2](/wiki/Performance_Points/Performance_Point_Systems/ppv2) performance point algorithm and the [weighting system](/wiki/Performance_Points/Weighting_System).

The dedicated total performance points ranking for all players can be found on the [global leaderboards](https://osu.ppy.sh/rankings/osu/performance). It can also be navigated to by hovering the `rankings` menu on the website header and clicking the `performance` option.

A player's individual ranking can also be seen almost anywhere within the osu! game client [interface](/wiki/Interface).
