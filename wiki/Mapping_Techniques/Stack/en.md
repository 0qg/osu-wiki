# Stack

![](./img/stack.jpg "An example of two circles stacking ontop of a sliderhead.")

A stack refers to [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) that [overlap](/wiki/Mapping_Techniques/Overlap) each other in the playfield. The most common object that is stacked are hit circles.

Stacks are automatically created when hit objects are close to perfectly overlaping each other. The time between objects for this to occur is determined by stack leniency.
