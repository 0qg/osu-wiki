## Creative

### Blanket Combos

_Also known as: **Blanket Formation**_

Nominator(s): [m980](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/3288)

Blanket Combos is made up of a slider or a hit circle (as the base) with a slider that surrounds that object.
Spacing between these two objects are very imporant as they are not allowed to overlay each other!

### Divebomb Combos

Nominator(s): [m980](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/3288)

Divebomb Combos are made up of a straight line of hitobjects traveling from the top of the screen (or the middle) towards the bottom.
This makes the hitobjects appear as if they are diving.

The last object should always be a slider.

### Flower Combos

_Also known as: **Flower Formation**_

Nominator(s): [0_o](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/56708)

Flower Combos consist of 5 or more hit circles that are all placed around a central point.
The central point can be a hit circle or a slider.

The hitobjects are usually a half beat apart.

Alternativly, you could use the end of a slider as the first point (or the start of a slider as the last point) of the flower.

These are really similar to [Star Formation](../Star_Formation/).
However, the difference here is that this forces the player to go along the edges of the hit circles, not through it.

### Honeycomb Beats

Nominator(s): MetalMario201

Honeycomb Beats is a stream of hit circles that are usually half beats apart.
These are placed in a fashion that they all fit on a hexagonal grid.

Using this technique will cause confusion as to what the order of hit circles are by looking at the circles alone.
This forces the player to look at the numbers and/or the approach circles to figure out the order or memorize them.

This could be combined with a low Approach Rate to confuse the player.

### Star Formations

Nominator(s): [Xgor](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/98661)

A Star Formation is a 5 pointed star, using 5 or 6 hit circles (the sixth one would usually be placed underneath the first point to complete the star).
The star can visually appear by following the followpoints.

Star Formations can be used to make jumps.

Alternativly, you could use the end of a slider as the first point (or the start of a slider as the last point) of the star.

These are really similar to [Flower Combos](../Flower_Combos/).
However, the difference here is that this forces the player to go through to form a star, instead of going around it.

### The Kickstream

Nominator(s): [Daru](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/32480)

The Kickstream uses a kick slider (a really short slider) inside of a stream.
This forces the player to pause in the middle of the stream to complete the kick, before continuing the stream.

### Tornado Combos

Nominator(s): [Dragvon](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/126927)

Tornado Formation are sets of notes that forces the player to tap circles in a circular motion at a high rate.
This is basically a combination of small jumps (distance-wise) and streams (reaction time-wise).

This can also be a [Square Formation](../Square_Formation/) and/or [Diamond Formation](../Diamond_Formation/) repeated a few times, where one of the notes acts like a pivot point.

### ztrot Spacing

_Also known as: **ztrot Formation**_

Nominator(s): JarJarJacob

ztrot Spacing uses consistant beats placed in a circle-like shape.
The distance between each note increases, then decreases.
The following hit circles will always be on opposite sides of the "circle".

It is recommended to do this with half (or more) beats apart from each other.

After the "circle" is completed, a few more hit circles are placed to go straight through it.

## Symmetrical Shapes

_See [Mapping Techniques/Basics](../Basics/#symmetry) for a description on symmetry._

### Circle Formation

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Diamond Formation

Nominator(s): QiiXshinez

The diamond formation is just like the [Square Formation](../Square_Formation) or [Square Formation v2](../Square_Formation_v2) but uses rhombi instead of squares.

### Double Stacks

Nominator(s): [-Xero-](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/179314) and [F1r3tar](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/5590317)

Double stacks uses two notes (or one note and a slider end) that are stacked on top of each other.

### QQ Diamonds

Nominator(s): [Lybydose](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/64501)

QQ Diamonds are four circles placed one beat apart from each other in a diamond pattern along the four edges (not corners) of the screen.
This is similar to [Diamond Formation](../Diamond_Formation/), but these are placed at the ends of the x-axis and y-axis.

In gaming, "QQ" originates from Warcraft II, where the player is able to press `Alt` + `Q` + `Q` to immediately leave the battle.
When a player in the chat tells you to "QQ", they are telling you to leave because you are unskilled to play.

### Reversed Zig-zag Sliders

Nominator(s): 

Reversed Zig-Zag Sliders is a variation of the [Zig-Zag Sliders](../Zig-Zag_Sliders/) but has the sliders point outwards and away from the next slider.
This creates a quick jump for the player.

### Square Formation

Nominator(s): Beuchi-chan

Basically, this is 4 hit circles forming a square shape.
These usually have some space between each other.
The square can be angled to form a diamond.
The order of the combos forces the player to go along the square rather than through it.

### Square Formation v2

Nominator(s): Beuchi-chan and MetalMario201

These are pretty much the same as [Square Formation](../Square_Formation), but the order of the circles forces you to go diagonally through the square.

### Triangle Beats

_Also known as: **Triangle Formation**_

Nominator(s): [kingcobra52](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/9934)

This is a very common mapping technique where 3 hit circles are arranged in a triangle.
The order of the 3 hit circles nor the size of the triangle does not matter.

### Zig-Zag Sliders

_Also known as: **Zig-Zag Formation**_

Nominator(s): [0_o](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/56708)

Zig-Zag Sliders are made up of 1/2 sliders that are arranged in an inwards zig-zag pattern.

This technique needs at least two sliders that are a half beat long and are arranged something similar to the above image.
