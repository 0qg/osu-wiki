# Time-distance equality

**Time-distance equality** is an [osu!](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!) mapping technique where spacing between [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) on the playfield is proportional to the duration of time between them. This is automatically calculated by the [distance snap](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Distance_Snap) feature of the editor.

Lower difficulties use time-distance equality to make gameplay more intuitive for new players.
