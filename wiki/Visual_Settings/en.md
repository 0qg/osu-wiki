# Visual Settings

![Example of Visual Settings](./VisualSettings.jpg "Example of Visual Settings")

**Visual Settings** is a hidden setting located at the bottom of a beatmap's playfield a few seconds before the beatmap starts. When the `Visual Settings` is shown, the beatmap will be delayed until the osu!cursor left the `Visual Settings` screen.

Alternatively, it is possible to pause to access `Visual Settings` but the pause method will not work in a [Multi](/wiki/Multi) match due to the keybind to pause is rebinded to quit the room instead when pressed twice.
