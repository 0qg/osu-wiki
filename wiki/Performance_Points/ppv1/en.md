ppv1
==========

The **first performance score** (abbreviated as **ppv1**) is an ancient ranking system for players globally and nationally of all modes from osu!. It replaced the old system of *ranking by total score* and was abandoned for the benefit of the [ppv2] (Performance_Points wiki/Performance_Points).

Historical
----------

ppv1 were launched in April 2012 and initially mentioned in the players profiles under the name ``???`` during a test phase. Then finally renamed to **pp** (performance point) on April 17, 2012. This system existed with the previous ranking system (by total score) and eventually became the unique system in place on 24 July 2012 during the release of the version [20120722-24] (http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/p/1687719) of the osu! client. 


This system was initially updated at regular intervals, usually every 24 hours, to finally run in real-time on August 16, 2012.

It was abandoned and replaced by [ppv2] on January 27 2014 as a result of criticism by the players on the opacity of the algorithm. The promotion of ``Hard`` difficulties played with mods to the detriment of insane difficulties. It also allowed peppy to deport the job of maintaining and updating the filing system to and thus ease its workload.

Algorithm
----------

The calculations involved were not publicly known, however some indications on the inner workings of the system were disclosed:

- Highlights the skill and can not be farmed.
- The score by map is evaluated in relation to the difficulty of the map, based on statistics that are not available to the public.
- The number of points obtainable naturally decreases with time (thus, an inactive player for one year will lose up to half of his points).
- No penalties awarded for bad scores, only rewards for good scores.
- All maps *ranked* and *approved* are taken into account in the calculations
- The percentage accuracy is taken into account.
- The multipliers of the mods are different from those announced in the game and want to be more just.
- For modes of play other than osu !, difficulties specific to modes are favored.
- If a score is not placed in the top 500 of a map, it is not counted.

Climb the rankings
----------

Your ranking is mainly related to your performance on individual maps. The easiest way to improve is to improve your ranking on difficult maps.

- Play better, score better on the beatmaps,
- Make sure to get some very good scores rather than thousands of mediocre scores,
- Improve your accuracy. Even a small percent can make all the difference!
- Rank on the most popular maps, where it is harder to get a place.
- Play difficult maps.
- Improve your old records.
- Get SS grades.
