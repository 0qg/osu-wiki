Performance Points
==================

Performance Points (pp) is a ranking metric that aims to be more contextually relevant to a players in a continuous game like *osu!*.

It aims to shift the focus of skill progression from the amount of time played to an **actual representation of the player's skill.**

History
=======

Revealed to the public during April 2012 as the mysterious *'???'* testing phase, the system was eventually renamed to "pp" later on in the month. Several months after its reveal, the [(20120722-24) osu! release](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/p/1687719) officially implemented the system to fully replace the old Ranked score system, with new scores being calculated every 30 minutes. Later on in August in the same year, the system was improved to update in real-time. 

It continued to exist in this capacity for more than a year of service, until [Tom94](http://osu.ppy.sh/u/1857058), the creator of the *osu!tp* scoring metric, joined the osu! team and implemented his design into the system. The resulting system was titled *ppv2*, and became live on the 27th of January, 2014.

*ppv2* is currently in active service, with live updates published to its [changelog](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/changelog?category=pp).

*ppv1*, the original build of the Performance Points system also had a changelog, which you may view from its [forum topic](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/92185).

FAQ

## Where can I view the performance ranking?

**The performance points ranking for all players can be found [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/pp).**

You can also navigate to the rankings by using the `Ranking` dropdown panel at the top of the legacy web design, and choosing the `Performance` option.

## How can I increase my rank/overall pp?

**Your performance is ranked predominately based on your scores on individual maps.**

The best way to improve is to thus work at getting good scores on difficult maps, or playing a wide variety of beatmaps.

Consider the following tips:

- Play efficiently and figure out which play style works best for you.
- Focus on getting a handful of excellent scores, instead of "farming" hundreds of just okay scores.
- Aim to improve your accuracy. Even 1% makes a massive difference.
- Aim for higher combos. Full combos (FC) or perfect (SS) scores give tremendous amounts of score.

## Why didn't I gain the full amount of pp from a map I played?

**Performance points use a _weighted_ system, which means that your highest score ever will give 100% of its total pp, and every score you make after that will give gradually less.**

To explain this with an example:

If your top pp rankings has only two maps played, both of which are 100pp scores, your total pp would then be _195pp_.

The first score is worth 100% of its total pp as it is your top score. The second score is worth only 95% of its total pp as it is not your top score, so it contributes only 95pp towards your total instead of 100.

This means that as you gradually improve at osu!, your pp totals will trend upwards, making your older scores worth progressively less compared to the newer, more difficult scores that you are updating them with.

### Is weighting the reason behind why I don't get any pp from playing easy maps any more?

**Yes, exactly.**

As above, older scores will eventually be weighted for less than a single percent of their total value. This means they will contribute almost nothing to your total score.

At that point however, you would've set some comparatively more impressive scores, meaning that your pp will be higher overall.

## Why did I lose pp for setting a new score?

**You might occasionally lose pp for setting a higher combo score with worse accuracy, or playing with mods with worse accuracy overall.**

Total score is still important to individual map rankings, and this may produce unusual circumstances where a higher overall score with lower accuracy or mod use factored in will produce a "better" result that still ultimately loses you pp.

## Some mods feel very overweighted/underweighted. Why is this?

**This is a matter of opinion more than anything else.**

No system is completely perfect, and performance point totals will certainly vary between mapsets and certain mod combinations, even when the subjective difficulty of those plays may be lower than a more difficult map.

Overall, the current performance points system has been engineered to be as fair as possible under the constraints of its model.
