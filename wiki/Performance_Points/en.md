# Performance points

*For a more detailed explanation, see [Performance point systems](Performance_Point_Systems).*

**Performance points** (*pp*) represent the difficulty of obtaining a score on a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). Only the highest performance point play on a beatmap will award it's pp value, though scores can be overwritten if a better play is made. How many performance points are awarded depends on the implementation of the current [performance point system](Performance_Point_Systems).

Performance points are a huge part in determining a player's rank as they are used to to calculate a user's [total performance points](/wiki/Performance_Points/Total_Performance_Points).
