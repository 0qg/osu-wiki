# Offset wizard

*See also: [How To Use The Offset Wizard](/wiki/Guides%2FHow_to_Use_the_Offset_Wizard) and [universal offset](/wiki/Universal_offset)*

To access the Offset Wizard, open the [Options](..) menu and type `offset` into the quick-search. Then click on the `Offset wizard` button.

The Offset Wizard is used to assist you in calibrating your [universal offset](/wiki/Universal_offset) to the correct value for your device. This is necessary when the [hitsounds](/wiki/Beatmapping/Hitsound) feel out of sync with the music, across every beatmap you play. You can read more about how to do this [Here](/wiki/Guides%2FHow_to_Use_the_Offset_Wizard).

Upon opening the Offset Wizard, you will be greeted with a metronome playing and vertical green bars scrolling across the screen repeatedly. The song you last had playing/selected will begin playing, however, you can change what song is playing at the top right of the screen via the `Now Playing` menu. These are the main elements in helping you adjust your universal offset.

Your current universal offset will be displayed at the top left of the screen, which you can change by pressing the `Up arrow` and `Down arrow`, or the `Scroll wheel` on your mouse.

Underneath the universal offset display are three options that change the speed of the metronome. Enabling `Half tick` will double the amount of time between ticks on the metronome, making it slower, and reveals the `Tick on other beat` option. Enabling `Tick on other beat` will keep the time between metronome ticks the same as `Half tick`, but changes what tick it begins on, therefore offsetting it. Lastly, enabling `Double tick` will halve the amount of time between ticks on the metronome, making it faster. These options are used to adjust the metronome, to make it better fit the song that is playing.

The green bars scrolling across the screen are "ticks". When they pass through the vertical line in the centre of the screen, they will flash white and will play a tick sound to represent the beat. Ticks add a useful visual aspect in the process of calibrating your universal offset.

To exit the Offset Wizard, simply click the `Back` button at the bottom left of the screen. Upon exiting, the universal offset value displayed in the Offset Wizard screen will be set as your universal offset.
