# Skinning

Skinning is one of the fundamentals of all osu! game modes. It enables players to derive from the original skinning elements to create their own!

Skins vary from for-fun to a central theme (e.g. anime or group of people) to those that are nigh impossible to play with. Another type of skin are PRO skins, where they maximize playfield visibility and minimize visual obtrusions (e.g. replacing hitbursts with blank images).

## Skinning sets

*See also: [Skin Set List](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/Skin_Set_List/).*

**For beatmaps only,** if your beatmap skin contains a single element from the listed sets in the Ranking Criteria, it must contain all of the other elements within said skinning set. This only applies to beatmap skins, but other skinners may want to consider those lists as well.
