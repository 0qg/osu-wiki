# Skin

A set of graphics and custom sample sets (audio clips) that can replace the default ones used by osu!. This will allow for a more customised user experience. Most of what you see and hear in osu! can be skinned.

To see the dedicated sub-forum for skins, see [Skinning](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/15).

To see the list of skinnable elements, see [Skinning](/wiki/Skinning) (and its subpages).
