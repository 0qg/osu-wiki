Star Rating and Web Icons
-------------------------

![](SR_range.png "SR_range.png")

-   From the [Ranking Criteria](Ranking_Criteria "wikilink"):-
    -   Below 1.5: Easy ![](easy-s.png "fig:easy-s.png")
    -   Below 2.25: Normal ![](diffeasy.png "fig:diffeasy.png")
    -   Below 3.75: Hard ![](diffhard.png "fig:diffhard.png")
    -   Below 5.25: Insane ![](insane-s.png "fig:insane-s.png")
    -   Above 5.25: Expert ![](diffexpert.png "fig:diffexpert.png")

This is the range that decides which Web Icons are used depending on the star rating of any given map. Following the icon range is a good estimate to achieve a balanced difficulty spread. There are some guidelines you can follow to improve the difficulty spread of your mapset.

[Standard](Standard "wikilink") difficulty spreads
--------------------------------------------------

From the [Ranking Criteria](Ranking_Criteria "wikilink"):-

  
"**The difficulties in the mapset must be in a consecutive order. Easy or Normal can be skipped if the gap in the star rating spread allows it. If your mapset has two difficulties, one of them cannot be an Insane or Expert. The lowest difficulty must be below 2.0 stars.**"

-   Consecutive order means this is the expected full spread ![](easy-s.png "fig:easy-s.png") ![](diffeasy.png "fig:diffeasy.png") ![](diffhard.png "fig:diffhard.png") ![](insane-s.png "fig:insane-s.png") ![](diffexpert.png "fig:diffexpert.png")
-   Depending on the star rating gap several combinations of lower difficulties are theoretically allowed:
    -   ![](easy-s.png "fig:easy-s.png")(1.4) ![](diffhard.png "fig:diffhard.png")(2.5) ![](diffhard.png "fig:diffhard.png")(3.6)
    -   ![](easy-s.png "fig:easy-s.png")(1.4) ![](diffhard.png "fig:diffhard.png")(2.6) ![](insane-s.png "fig:insane-s.png")(3.8)

<!-- -->

-   It is generally allowed to skip the **\[Easy\]** difficulty if the **\[Normal\]** difficulty follows the general guidelines of an Easy map
    -   ![](diffeasy.png "fig:diffeasy.png") ![](diffhard.png "fig:diffhard.png") ![](insane-s.png "fig:insane-s.png") ![](diffexpert.png "fig:diffexpert.png")

<!-- -->

-   It is **NOT** allowed to skip a huge difficulty range like **\[Hard\]** or **\[Insane\]**

-   Depending on the prevalent gameplay elements in your **\[Insane\]** and **\[Expert\]** you could be asked to include another lower or higher rated additional **\[Insane\]**

A good difficulty spread is **more than just Star Rating and Web Icons**! However, the icons help players to get a quick overview and if possible you should always aim to use them appropriately.

Example Taiko Spreads
---------------------

From the [Ranking Criteria](Ranking_Criteria "wikilink"):-

-   **The difficulties in the mapset must be in a consecutive order.** Easy or Normal can be skipped if the gap in the star rating spread allows it. If your mapset has two difficulties, one of them cannot be an Insane or Expert. The lowest difficulty must be below 2.0 stars.
-   '''A mapset cannot have just one Taiko difficulty. ''' If you decide to include Taiko in your map, make sure you have at least 2 Taiko mode difficulties and that one of them is of an easier difficulty level if it doesn't have an osu! standard Easy level difficulty.

A common set contains the following four difficulties: Kantan, Futsuu, Muzukashii and Oni which difficulty spread between them **should be approximately kept the same**. To achieve this, it is highly recommended to set a **main snapping** for each difficulty which **follows the pace of the song**. If the spread still happens to be uneven, you may move to another type of set which contains an additional Inner Oni and sometimes even an Ura Oni. These difficulties can be used as filler in a mapset to ensure a consistent spread in case four difficulties are not enough. Also in this way, an **Oni can be mapped easier for people who are still not familiar with harder difficulties, while Inner/Ura serves as harder Oni**.

-   Common set: ![](easy-t.png "fig:easy-t.png")![](normal-t.png "fig:normal-t.png")![](hard-t.png "fig:hard-t.png")![](insane-t.png "fig:insane-t.png")

Make sure that your every single difficulty **fits to the overall spread**.

To have an idea of how these sets can be build up, examples will be given:

**Example 1:** Having a main snapping through all difficulty which patterns vary depending on the pace of the song.

-   ![](easy-t.png "fig:easy-t.png") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1
-   ![](normal-t.png "fig:normal-t.png") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1
-   ![](hard-t.png "fig:hard-t.png") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2
-   ![](insane-t.png "fig:insane-t.png") Main snapping 1/2 + 1/4

**Example 2:** Same snapping case but with the difference of having at certain places denser patterns. Good for songs which support harder mapsets.

-   ![](easy-t.png "fig:easy-t.png") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1 with some 1/1
-   ![](normal-t.png "fig:normal-t.png") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1 with some 1/2
-   ![](hard-t.png "fig:hard-t.png") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2 with some 1/4
-   ![](insane-t.png "fig:insane-t.png") Main snapping 1/2 + 1/4 with harder 1/4 or 1/6

**Example 3:** Sometimes the snapping behaviour can shift threw the diffs, depending on the songs BPM. In this case the difficulties have lower density due to a slow BPM song and does not require a Kantan since Futsuu is sufficient enough. It should be noted that the controvers case is possible, but it rather leans to a behaviour of **example 2**.

-   ![](normal-t.png "fig:normal-t.png") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1
-   ![](hard-t.png "fig:hard-t.png") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1
-   ![](insane-t.png "fig:insane-t.png") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2

**Example 4 what should not happen:** Difference between Oni and Muzukashii is too big which makes the entry from one to the other diff really hard, while Muzukashii to Futsuu is denser and makes the spread inconsistent.

-   ![](easy-t.png "fig:easy-t.png") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1
-   ![](normal-t.png "fig:normal-t.png") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1
-   ![](hard-t.png "fig:hard-t.png") Main snapping 1/1 + **easy 1/2**
-   ![](insane-t.png "fig:insane-t.png") Main snapping 1/2 + **demanding 1/4**

**Example 5 what should not happen:** While the transition from Kantan to Futsuu and Muzukashii to Oni is fine, Futsuu to Muzukashii spread happens to be bigger since Futsuu doesn't have any 1/2 for a better transition into Muzukashii and hence, the spread is uneven and spitted in lower and higher difficulties. Example 2 should be followed to fix such problems.

-   ![](easy-t.png "fig:easy-t.png") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1 with 1/1
-   ![](normal-t.png "fig:normal-t.png") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1
-   ![](hard-t.png "fig:hard-t.png") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2 with 1/4
-   ![](insane-t.png "fig:insane-t.png") Main snapping 1/2 + 1/4

<!-- -->

-   Different type of set:![](easy-t.png "fig:easy-t.png")![](normal-t.png "fig:normal-t.png")![](hard-t.png "fig:hard-t.png")![](insane-t.png "fig:insane-t.png")![](expert-t.png "fig:expert-t.png")

While Inner and Ura Oni are normally in use for hard Onis, they can also be used for **fixing spread problems**. For example, if a spread happens to become too large between two difficulties, you can either try refining the existing difficulties to fit the spread or add a **new map** if the gap between two difficulties is too large to be refined. **Example 6:** This would be a common set with additional Inner / Ura Oni a song can carry.

-   ![](easy-t.png "fig:easy-t.png") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1
-   ![](normal-t.png "fig:normal-t.png") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1
-   ![](hard-t.png "fig:hard-t.png") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2
-   ![](insane-t.png "fig:insane-t.png") Main snapping 1/2 + 1/4
-   ![](expert-t.png "fig:expert-t.png") Main snapping 1/2 + demanding 1/4

**Example 7:** Such sets are also possible; having in general a common set with an additional really hard Oni for high tier players.

-   ![](easy-t.png "fig:easy-t.png") Main snapping 4/1 + easy 2/1
-   ![](normal-t.png "fig:normal-t.png") Main snapping 2/1 + easy 1/1
-   ![](hard-t.png "fig:hard-t.png") Main snapping 1/1 + easy 1/2
-   ![](insane-t.png "fig:insane-t.png") Main snapping 1/2 + easy 1/4
-   ![](expert-t.png "fig:expert-t.png") Main snapping 1/2 + demanding 1/4

### Taiko Guest Difficulties

  
Note: **M** = Mapper

![](hard-t.png "fig:hard-t.png")![](insane-t.png "fig:insane-t.png")![](insane-t.png "fig:insane-t.png")(M1,M1,M2) ![](icon_arrow.gif "fig:icon_arrow.gif") ![](hard-t.png "fig:hard-t.png")![](insane-t.png "fig:insane-t.png")![](expert-t.png "fig:expert-t.png") (M1,M1,M2)

-   As second mapper, always think about ''' what difficulty ''' could fit ''' better *' to the GD-Set. Instead of another Oni which is mapped similar to the previous one, you could add a <span style="color:#0000FF">*' Futsuu '''</span> or ''' <span style="color:#8000FF">Inner Oni</span> ''' to the set.

![](hard-t.png "fig:hard-t.png")![](insane-t.png "fig:insane-t.png")![](insane-t.png "fig:insane-t.png")(M1,M1,M2) ![](icon_arrow.gif "fig:icon_arrow.gif") ![](normal-t.png "fig:normal-t.png")![](hard-t.png "fig:hard-t.png")![](insane-t.png "fig:insane-t.png") (M1,M1,M2)

-   Think about lower/new players. They are the ''' <span style="color:#FF0000">future for our community</span> ''', so give them easy difficulties to get used to '' Taiko ''. <span style="color:#FF0000">♥</span>

![](hard-t.png "fig:hard-t.png")![](insane-t.png "fig:insane-t.png") ![](icon_arrow.gif "fig:icon_arrow.gif") ![](normal-t.png "fig:normal-t.png")![](hard-t.png "fig:hard-t.png")

-   A song doesn't always require an Oni. Think about mapping lower difficulties.

<!-- -->

-   Make lower players happy by giving them easier difficulties. Experienced players can use several mods to make the map harder for themself.

Rest moments in Taiko
---------------------

**Rest moments** or **breaks** are really important in a Taiko beatmap and can be seen as the *hidden extra note*. They have a great influence when it's about the **difficulty** and **spread** of a mapset and can **emphasize certain places** in a map. Beside following the song, the length of a rest moment depends also of the **main snapping** in a map. So if for example a Muzukashii has a main snapping of 2/1 + 1/1, the breaks should be bigger than this snapping to **avoid continuous mapping**. Sometimes the length of a rest moment can also vary by the hardness of the previous pattern but this rather apply to lower difficulties.

**Example what break maps could have:**

-   ![](easy-t.png "fig:easy-t.png") Main snapping 4/1 + 2/1 with 4/1 ( same break like snapping is fine in Kantan due to often being easy anyway )
-   ![](normal-t.png "fig:normal-t.png") Main snapping 2/1 + 1/1 with 3/1 or 4/1 breaks
-   ![](hard-t.png "fig:hard-t.png") Main snapping 1/1 + 1/2 with 3/2 or 2/1 breaks
-   ![](insane-t.png "fig:insane-t.png") Main snapping 1/2 + 1/4 with 1/1 breaks

For skilled mappers / players who are having problems to distinguish when a lower difficulty becomes too hard, you can try playing your beatmap on **[T-Aiko!](T-Aiko! "wikilink")** which gives you a different difficulty feeling and can show how lower player could feel when playing your maps.
