# FAQ

## osu! Introduction

### I've never played this "Ouendan" thing - what is it?
_[Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan][ouendan wikipedia]_ is a rhythm game for the Nintendo DS. The gameplay consists of only three elements: tapping circles on the touchscreen, dragging a ball across a fixed path and rotating a spinner very fast. All these elements are timed to (covers of) popular Japanese songs. It looks like this on the DS:-

![Gameplay footage of Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan in Nintendo DS][ouendan image]

You can see the circles on the bottom screen, and on the top screen you have the story. Each stage is basically a self-contained story about a person in trouble. That's where the _Ouendan_ (Cheer squad) comes in. Through the magical power of male cheerleading, you have to help the people in trouble.

### How do I play?
_Full explanation: [osu!][osu wikilink]_

While most PC users will not have a touchscreen at their disposal, this game was made to be playable with a normal mouse, as well as any number of input devices you can possibly think of. Different play styles can be found in the [Play Styles][Play_Styles wikilink] page. There are some songs which will push the limits of the normal mouse (and you), but all the (ranked and approved) beatmaps have been tested and (most can be) passable using only a mouse.

#### Game-play Basics
_Tutorial: [(Bundled with PC osu!) Original tutorial][osu!tutorial basic], [Ranked beatmap version][osu!tutorial rank]_

The game-play puts emphasis on your:-
-   Adaptability and reaction to stimuli (that is, the hittable objects appearing all over the screen at lightning speed).
-   Understanding of the song beat and design.
-   Your control of your mouse (or your fingers/pen-control skills if you are using a tablet instead).
-   Timing of your hits on the object that appeared on the screen.
-   Ability to spin the mouse (or your finger/pen for tablet) on spinners.
-   Your physical stamina (especially marathon songs).
-   Proper mouse positioning and hand-eye coordination.
-   Your hardware capability (especially your mouse/tablet).

These are some of the vital skills you will learn as you progress your journey on becoming an osu! rhythm master. Before you set out to become a rhythm master, you must learn the basics (and theories) of the hittable objects.

Let us learn about what the hittable objects are, shall we?

##### Hitcircles
![Hitcircles][osu_hitcircles image]

Here you can see the circles you have to tap.

A thin, similarly-coloured approach circle on the outside of the hitcircle will shrink over time. You will have to tap on the note at the exact point when it touches the white border of the hitcircle.

To understand the hidden charm of hitcircles, you should not only rely on your perception (your eyes) but also the beatmap's beats and rhythm with your ears (auditory).

##### Sliders
![Sliders][osu_slider image]

Here we have a slider.

First, you will have to tap on it at the right moment, however, it does not end there. A ball will begin to move across the path you see. You will have to hold the mouse/keyboard-button (or your finger/pen on the tablet) and follow the ball within the thick orange circle, surrounding the ball, as it moves. The orange outer circle will appear if you are holding onto the slider's ball, but will disappear when you release it.

Sometimes, as seen in the screenshot above, you may have to follow the ball back to the start of the path or vice versa. You will need to do this when you see the reverse symbol at the end of the path.

##### Spinners
![Spinner][osu_spinner image]

This is a spinner.

You will have to click and hold the hit-button. From there, you will have to use the mouse (or your finger/pen) and spin in a circular motion (clockwise or counterclockwise) before the time (blue circle line) runs out. The gauges on the outside of the spinner will indicate how close you are to passing the spinner. The small box below the spinner shows your spins per minute. The number inside that box translates to the number of spins you could make, if you were to continue to spin the spinner at that speed for one minute. Know that you will be unable to spin the spinner if you did not hold any of the hit-buttons prior to spinning.

On the DS, this is a good way to scratch your touchscreen (or screen protectors), especially on the higher difficulties. In osu!, spinners have been toned down as to not be such a nuisance to complete. The maximum number of spins per minute achievable is 477 which is also the rate at which the [Auto][Auto wikilink] game modifier spins while the [Spun Out][Spun Out wikilink] game modifier spins slower at 287 spins per minute.

#### In-Game Interface
![osu! interface][osu! Interface image]

This is the in-game interface for osu!.

The top left bar is your health. This will decrease at a steady rate (depending on the beatmap difficulty set by the mapper), but you can replenish it by tapping notes at the right time. A perfectly timed hit (a 300 or Geki) will increase your health more than a badly timed hit (50). A total miss will take a good chunk of your health out.

On the right of the health bar is your score. Below that is your accuracy. The circle beside your accuracy (and below your score) is a timer for the duration of the beatmap. The number on the bottom left is your combo counter/score multiplier.

## Alternative Game Modes
### How to change game mode?
![Mode change interface][Mode Interface image]

_Image showcasing the Mode toolbox in Song Selection (Solo)_

Click on the _Mode_ button to **open up a list of gameplay modes available on osu!**. Click on your desired gameplay mode, and osu! will switch to that gameplay mode style, along with relevant scoreboard change. Alternatively, you can press `Ctrl` and `1` (![osu! icon][osu! icon link] [osu!standard][osu! wikilink]) / `2` ( ![osu!taiko icon][osu!taiko icon link] [osu!taiko][osu!taiko wikilink]) / `3` (![osu!catch icon][osu!catch icon link] [osu!catch][osu!catch wikilink]) / `4` (![osu!mania icon][osu!mania icon link] [osu!mania][osu!mania wikilink]) on your keyboard to quickly switch to your desired gameplay mode.

### What is osu!taiko?
_Full explanation: [osu!taiko][osu!taiko wikilink]_

![osu!taiko Interface][osu!taiko Interface image]

_[Taiko no Tatsujin][Taiko no Tatsujin wikipedia]_ is a taiko drum rhythm game made by Namco. This game involves the simulation of playing the taiko drum to the beat of the music. In osu!, beatmaps can be played in the styling of Taiko no Tatsujin through the use of osu!taiko game mode.

Like osu! game mode, there are three elements of gameplay.

#### Basic explanation

##### Hitcircles
![Taiko hitcircles][Taiko hitcircles image]

Each hitcircles will appear as either a red or a pale-blue circle. Those coloured circles were named Don (red notes) and Katu (blue notes) respectively.

If it is a small red note, you must press the button bound to the inner portion of the taiko drum or hit the large flat area (center) of the TaTaCon. If it is a small blue note, you must press the button bound to the outer ring of the taiko drum or hit the sides of the TaTaCon. If the note is a **LARGE** circle, you should press or hit both of either inner or outer drum depending on the colour of the note for additional points.

The notes must be pressed or hit when they reach the small white circle next to the drum below the status bar on the playfield.

##### Drum rolls
![Taiko drumroll][Taiko drumroll image]

Drum rolls appears as yellow bar in the playfield with tiny hitcircles evenly-spaced inside.

You should hit the inner (or outer) drum continuously for points until it is done. For **LARGE** note, you should hit both buttons on the inner (or outer) drum simultaneously and continuously until it is done. Do note that drum rolls hits were hardcapped and only counted when you hit on the tiny hitcircles, rather than drumrolling as fast as you can as in _Taiko no Tatsujin_.

You can choose to ignore them with no health penalty. However, it will cost you points that you could have gained from the drum roll.

##### Dendens
![Taiko spinner][Taiko spinner image]

These appear as spinners, with a countdown displaying the time you have remaining to clear it.

You must hit the inner and outer drum in order (like red,red, blue,blue, red,red, and so on) until the Denden meter is full. Bonus points are given for extra hits after completing the Denden.

#### Controls
The default controls for the osu!taiko are:

Type | Mouse | Keyboard | TaTaCon
---|---|---|---
Red |Left click |`X` or `C`|Flat surface of the drum
Blue|Right click|`Z` or `V`|Outer surface of the drum

The placement of your in-game cursor does not matter when playing.

### What is osu!catch?
_Full explanation: [osu!catch][osu!catch wikilink]_

![osu!catch Interface][osu!catch Interface image]

_osu!catch_ (previously known as _Catch the Beat_) is the second game mode added to osu!, after osu!taiko game mode.

Instead of clicking circles, you are now tasked to move the catcher at the bottom of the screen while the fruits fall from above.

#### Controlling the catcher
-   By default, the left `<-` and right `->` arrow keys are used to move the catcher.
-   Pressing the left `Shift` key with one of the arrow keys will make the catcher _dash_ in that direction at x1.5 speed (as indicated with a **bright glow** from the catcher).

If you enable the [Relax][Relax wikilink] mod, you can control the catcher with your in-game cursor instead. However, this will make your play unrankable.

### What is osu!mania?
_Full explanation: [osu!mania][osu!mania wikilink]_

![osu!mania Interface][osu!mania Interface image]

osu!mania is the third game mode added to osu!, after osu!taiko and osu!catch game modes.

This mode has been widely used in almost all of the major rhythm games. It require good hand and/or leg coordination where the notes (with their quantity depending on BPM and difficulty) move on a conveyer. With this, the player will have to press the correct key for that specific note in time. Though the game mode was originally made as an imitation of the Beatmania style of playing, osu!mania allows changing number of keys you play with (this means you can make it look more like Guitar Hero \[5 keys\] or Dance Dance Revolution \[4 keys\] and so on).

When converting an osu!standard beatmap, the default key range would be around 4 to 7 keys. With the [xK][xK wikilink] game modifier, you can manually set the number of keys you play with 1 to a total of 9 keys with a score multiplier reduction. However, this game modifier will not work with osu!mania-specific beatmaps. With the [Co-Op][Co-Op wikilink] game modifier, you can split the stage in two. This will use Co-Op's control scheme and will allows you to play with 2 to a total of 18 keys with a score multiplier reduction. Do note that while the preset number of keys will not be doubled on osu!mania-specific beatmaps, it will split the stage in two (left stage priority if odd-numbered), use Co-Op's control scheme, and no score multiplier reduction.

#### Controls
![Default Key layouts of osu!mania (Options-&gt;Input)][osu!mania key layout image]

There two different binding-styles, _Symmetrical_ and _Left to Right_.
-   _Symmetrical_ style mimics the button placement of DJMAX, in which the center key is `Spacebar` to simulate a feeling of stepping the pedal similar to the arcade version. Centre key matches the middle column (odd numbered keys only) and the other column matches the keys in its corresponding place.
-   _Left to Right_ style mimics the button placement of Beatmania IIDX, where the first column matches to the key1, then the second column matches the key2 and so on.

_Symmetrical_ key binding (For DJMAX style)
-   For _left_ hand buttons — (K1)`A`, (K2)`S`, (K3)`D`, (K4)`F`
-   For _right_ hand buttons — (K6)`J`, (K7)`K`, (K8)`L`, (K9)`;`.
-   *Center* button — (K5)`Spacebar`. \[On 5K and 7K only\]
-   The _Special_ button — `leftShift` and `leftCtrl`.

Key | L | C | R
:---:|:---|:---:|---:
4K|K3, K4|-|K6, K7
5K|K3, K4|K5|K6, K7
6K|K2, K3, K4|-|K6, K7, K8
7K|K2, K3, K4|K5|K6, K7, K8
8K|K1, K2, K3, K4|-|K6, K7, K8, K9

_Left to Right_ key binding (For Beatmania IIDX style)
-   From down to up then down to up again: (K1)`Z`, (K2)`S`, (K3)`X`, (K4)`D`, (K5)`C`, (K6)`F`, (K7)`V`, (K8)`G`, (K9)`B` \[K9 is not used\]
-   The *Special* button — `leftShift` and `leftCtrl`.

Key | Bindings
:---:|:---
4K|K1, K2, -, K4, K5
5K|K1, K2, K3, K4, K5
6K|K1, K2, K3, K4, K5, K6
7K|K1, K2, K3, K4, K5, K6, K7
8K|K1, K2, K3, K4, K5, K6, K7, K8

  -   If the beatmap has 3 difficulties, and you SS all three of them, you will receive 3 SS and not just one SS in your profile.

## Performance Points
_Full explanation: [Performance Points][Performance Points wikilink]_

Performance points (pp) is a ranking metric aiming to be more contextually relevant to a continuous game like osu!. It aims to shift the focus from being on the amount of time played to the actual skill of the player. Performance points is heavily based on map difficulty, determined by a unique algorithm in every game mode. Based on this difficulty alone, each of your scores will be rated and assigned a pp value. Your performance rank is predominantly based on your performance on individual maps. The easiest way to improve it is to improve your scores on difficult songs, and playing more songs. Do note that game modes are counted separately; playing osu!, osu!taiko, osu!catch, or osu!mania will raise the pp for that game mode.

If you have any questions regarding pp, please refer to the [wiki page for pp first][Performance Points#FAQ wikilink].

## Common issues and questions

### General

#### Where can I find and get the beatmaps?
_Detailed explanation of the beatmaps: [Beatmaps][Beatmaps wikilink]_

You can find it from the main page under the name "[Beatmaps][Beatmaplist link]". Just remember to log in to your osu! account beforehand or the server treats you as a guest and prohibit you from downloading beatmaps from the site.

#### Can I disable Kiai Time?
**No**, because unlike video, it is integrated to the game (as a part with the hit objects), thus cannot be disabled.

#### The maps are too hard! Where can I find some easier maps?
Pokebis has compiled a set of beatmaps suitable for beginners to play. You can find them here: <https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/5456>

Also, [the ranked beatmap version of osu! tutorial][osu!tutorial_rank] is good for practicing some of the possible mapping design you will come across. It is an excellent training map for newbies and experienced players.

Alternatively, you can [sort the ranked beatmap list by difficulty][sort beatmaplist difficulty]. The easiest maps are at the top of the list.

#### What does Level in my profile actually do?
**Absolutely nothing**. There is no difference in any way when comparing a Level 100 player against a Level 1 player except the player's own skills and experience of the game mode in question. There is no handicap for the lower level nor is there an advantage for the higher level (except personal experience and hardware used).

Level will be based on your total score accumulated when online with your account whether you passed or failed the beatmap. [Formula given here][Score#Level wikilink].

#### Why is my profile stats different ingame?
Keep in mind that osu! has four game modes so you might be looking at the wrong game mode.

![Profile_Mode_Buttons][Profile_Mode_Buttons image]

_Manually select the game mode at your profile that you want to view._

#### How do I change the default keyboard key input for my game mode of choice?
![Options sidebar with quickicons][Options quickicons image]

You may configure the keyboard buttons as you see fit, from the _Input_ icon in the _Options_ sidebar as shown above, under **Keyboard** section as shown below.

![Options keyboard section][Options keyboard image]

#### Why am I seeing random white lines on screen every time I play?
Make sure that the smoke/skywriting key binding is not the same as the key binding you use to tap with when playing.

![osu! smoke effect][osu_smoke image]

_Usage of Smoke_

![osu! smoke settings][osu_smoke_set image]

_Smoke in key bindings settings; hold `C` key to trigger by default in osu!_

<!-- ### Why do I not have the max possible combo when I have no misses? -->
<!-- You released a slider too early or you barely clicked the hitcircle. [Answer's Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/osugame/wiki/index "Reddit r/osugame's wiki") -->

### Beatmapping
#### "This beatmap you're trying to submit isn't owned by you!"
_For unranked beatmaps only._

![Example of an .osu file content][Beatmap_not_owned image]

Please follow these steps:-
1.  Leave the editor (or close osu!) to make sure the changes apply properly
2.  Check the name of the beatmap's folder
  -   If it starts with numbers, remove them. Otherwise, osu! will treat it as BeatmapSetID
3.  Make sure that the .mp3 does not start with numbers. Edit the filename in the .osu files if it does.
4.  Open all the .osu files with a text editor (Notepad will work)
  -   Set your name as creator (and replace it in the file name as well)
  -   Set the BeatmapID to 0
  -   Set the BeatmapSetID to -1
