# Drag

*Main Page: [Play Styles](/wiki/Play_Styles)*

Drag is a term used to describe the act of navigating (or "aiming") a [tablet](/wiki/Glossary#tablet) pen by physically touching the pen to the surface of the tablet and "dragging" it to the desired location (as opposed to [hovering](/wiki/Play_Styles/Hover)). This style is used by players of all skill levels and is easy to learn.

Arguments in-favor of dragging often claim that it is more comfortable/natural and is much harder to "overshoot" on [jumps](/wiki/Beatmaps/Pattern/Jump). 

By the same token, many players that argue against dragging claim that it can damage the surface of the tablet without the use of a tablet cover, requires purchasing replacement nibs (due to nib wear), and that the friction is (techincally) "slower".

*Notice: though players may argue, at the end of the day, it's all down to personal preference; there's no one play style/input method that's objectively better than the other.*
