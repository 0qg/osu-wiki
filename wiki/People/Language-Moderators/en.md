Most of the channels being present in osu! have their own moderators, which take care of anything that could invade or go against the atmosphere of the channel. While there are various QATs/GMTs taking care of these problems thanks to their power, there are various non-QAT chat OPs which moderate the channel in order to help the other moderators.
