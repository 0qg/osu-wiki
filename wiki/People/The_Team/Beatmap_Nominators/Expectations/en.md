# Expectations for Beatmap Nominators

*See also: [Beatmap Nominator Rules](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators/Rules)*

As central figures in their respective communities and osu! as a whole, [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators) are held to a higher standard than other users. The expectations listed here are the result of discussion within the [Nomination Assessment Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Nomination_Assessment_Team). While it's unreasonable to perfectly align with these expectations, going far out of line can lead to warnings and/or removal from the Beatmap Nominators. All situations are judged on a case-by-case basis depending on frequency, severity, judgement, and impact.

As a reminder, Beatmap Nominators are expected to do their best to adhere to the [code of conduct for modding and mapping](/wiki/Rules/Code_of_Conduct_for_Modding_and_Mapping) at all times. They should also always act within the best interest of maintaining the ranked section's quality.

- **The Golden Rule.** Do not fuck up. Beatmap Nominators are expected to not act rashly and approach situations with caution. They should act with sound judgement in all circumstances.
- **Do not exploit or abuse existing systems.** Following the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) and not trying to circumvent it is a given, and cases of disagreement should be resolved through a Ranking Criteria proposal. Beatmap Nominators should also not repeatedly exploit bugs or reward systems such as [score](/wiki/Score), [PP](/wiki/Performance_points) or [kudosu](/wiki/Modding/Kudosu).
- **Be civil outside the game's direct platform.** Beatmap Nominators are expected to not be openly antagonistic, inflammatory, or otherwise derogatory toward other members of the osu! community, both in and outside of the game's direct platform. This especially applies to large public/semi-public communities where other users commonly associate them to their account on osu! (e.g. mapping Discord servers or Twitter).
- **Mod regularly.** Beatmap Nominators are not only responsible for fixing unrankables, but also making the mapsets they're interested in nominating ready for rank, and ensuring their quality. They should always be vigilant and ready to mod thoroughly, just like they would have for their BN application.
- **Be approachable.** As members of the community who are often sought after, Beatmap Nominators should avoid giving the impression that they're unreachable or unwilling to communicate. However, this does not mean Beatmap Nominators are obliged to accept all requests.
- **Promote variety.** As main contributors to the ranked section, Beatmap Nominators should aim to provide the community with content from different mappers. They can have preferences, but their nominations should not only consist of the same mappers they, or to a lesser extent other BNs, have already nominated recently.
- **Keep improving!** Becoming a Beatmap Nominator is only the start of one's journey. There's still much to discuss and learn about. Beatmap Nominators are not only expected to help others, but also to ask for help when they're unsure about something.

Those wishing to become a Beatmap Nominator should understand these expectations before seeking to join.
