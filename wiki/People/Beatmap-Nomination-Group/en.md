The **Beatmap Nomination Group**, more commonly referred to as BN, is a group in charge of [beatmap nomination](Ranked_Beatmap "wikilink"). This group has undergone many changes recently. As of August 22, 2014, they are no longer a part of the staff, revoking their chat moderation in-game, red name in-game, and on the forums. The most recent change was on February 1, 2015 when the team was changed from Beatmap Appreciation Team to Beatmap Nominator Group and lost their red forum name.
