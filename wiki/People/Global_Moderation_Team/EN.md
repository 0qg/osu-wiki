**Global Moderation Team** (formerly known as the Administrators, Global Mod Team or “GreenBAT”), commonly referred to as **GMT**, are members of the osu!Staff whom are focused primarily on player moderation and issues pertinent to the staff and the community at large.

Becoming a GMT
--------------

Becoming a member of the **Global Moderation Team** is quite a difficult and intricate process. Potential members are often pointed out by their ability to speak a second language, then are discussed by the team for their possible potential as a team member.

Roles and Responsibilities
--------------------------

The Global Moderation Team is responsible for the welfare of the chat/forum and takes care of interactions with the community. They should be approached if you have any questions pertaining the moderation aspect of the game, which would include (but isn't limited to) issues with chat (silences, harassment) and the forum (spam).
