# Article styling criteria

*For news posts, see: [News Styling Criteria](/wiki/News_Styling_Criteria)*

The article styling criteria (ASC) serves as the osu! wiki's enforced styling standards to keep consistency in clarity, formatting, and layout in all articles.

All articles must have having proper grammar, correct spelling, and correct information.

To suggest changes regarding the article styling criteria, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/issues/new "GitHub").

## Standards

*Notice: [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119 "IETF Tools") is used to describe requirement levels.*

The article styling criteria is split up into two documents:

- [Formatting](Formatting): includes Markdown and other formatting rules
- [Writing](Writing): includes writing practices and other grammar rules
