# Writing

*For the formatting standards, see: [Article style criteria/Formatting](../Formatting)*

All English articles must use plain English.

## British English

British English spelling variants must be used when there are conflicting spellings of English words. For example, use:

- `colour` instead of `color`
- `centre` instead of `center`
- `skilful` instead of `skillful`
- `analyse` instead of `analyze`

## osu!

The name of the game, osu!, must not be capitalised or italicised. The osu! official branding must not use any spaces. Examples include:

- `osu!academy`
- `osu!api`
- `osu!catch`
- `osu!direct`
- `osu!keyboard`
- `osu!mania`
- `osu!store`
- `osu!stream`
- `osu!supporter`
- `osu!tablet`
- `osu!taiko`
- `osu!talk`
- `osu!tourney`

Other brandings that are not covered by the osu! official branding must use a space. Examples include:

- `osu! tournaments`
- `osu! community`
- `osu! chat`
- `osu! client`
- `osu! wiki`

User titles that include `osu!` as part of the title name must be capitalised. Examples include:

- `osu! Alumni`
- `osu! Champion`

---

`osu!` should not end the sentence. If it does however, use a full stop (`.`) (or question mark (`?`), if appropriate) to get `osu!.` (or `osu!?`).

`osu!` must not be followed by an exclamation mark (`!`) (i.e. `osu!!`). It must be rewritten to ensure that this will not occur.

## Capitalisation

### Article names

Article names, when written in a paragraph, must not be capitalised, unless it is a link that links to the article or it is a proper noun (e.g. BanchoBot). For example:

```markdown
The [Chat Console](/wiki/Chat_Console) is where you go to chat, using IRC (Internet Relay Chat). The chat console is located in the game client.
```

### Game modifiers

Game modifiers must have the word `mod` after the mod name to reduce ambiguity. These must be spelt as seen below (letter casing and spacing must match):

- `Easy` or `EZ`
- `No Fail` or `NF`
- `Half Time` or `HT`
- `Daycore` or `DC`
- `Hard Rock` or `HR`
- `Sudden Death` or `SD`
- `Perfect` or `PF`
- `Double Time` or `DT`
- `Nightcore` or `NC`
- `Fade In` or `FI`
- `Hidden` or `HD`
- `Flashlight` or `FL`
- `Relax` or `RL`
- `Autopilot` or `AP`
- `Target Practice` or `TP`
- `Spun Out` or `SO`
- `1K`, `2K`, `3K`, `4K`, `5K`, `6K`, `7K`, `8K`, and `9K`
  - If referring to the key mods collectively, use `xK`.
- `Co-op` or `CO`
- `Random` or `RD`
- `Auto` or `AT`
- `Cinema` or `CM`
- `Touch Device` or `TD`

---

Tournament articles are an exception and may use camel case (omit the space but keep the letter casing as seen above). For mappools with no or free mods, the game modifier name must be spelt as seen below (letter casing and spacing must match):

- `No Mods`, `No Mod`, `NoMods`, `NoMod`, or `NM`
- `Free Mods`, `Free Mod`, `FreeMods`, `FreeMod`, or `FM`
- `Tiebreaker`

### Gameplay elements

Gameplay elements must not be capitalised, unless it is a link that links to the article. For example:

```markdown
In osu!standard, beatmaps are composed of three different gameplay elements: hit circles, sliders, and spinners.
```

### Language names

Language names must be first-letter capitalised. For example:

```markdown
The `#spanish` chat channel is for those who speak Spanish.
```

### Proper nouns

Proper nouns must be first-letter capitalised. For example:

```markdown
Dean Herbert (also known as peppy) created osu! back in 2007.
```

### Trademarks

*For rules regarding osu!, see: [osu!](#osu!)*

The following trademarks must be spelt as follows (letter casing must match):

- `Discord`
- `Facebook`
- `GitHub`
- `Google`
- `Reddit`
- `Skype`
- `Twitch`
- `Twitter`
- `YouTube`

Trademarks must not be followed by the trademark or registered trademark symbols.

## Game modes

Game modes must be written as follows:

- `osu!standard` (unofficial, but used to prevent ambiguity)
- `osu!taiko`
- `osu!catch`
- `osu!mania`

*Notice: `osu!standard` is used to maintain consistency when referring to the game mode. Folder names, however, must use `osu!` even if it is referring to the game mode.*

Referring to the old game mode names (i.e. `Catch the Beat`, `Taiko`, and `Mania`) may be done if discussing about said game mode's previous name.

---

Articles such as the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) may use `osu!` instead of `osu!standard`.

## Terminology

These words must be spelt as follows (spacing must match):

- `approach circle`
- `game mode` (or `mode`)
- `game mod` (or `mod`)
- `gameplay`
- `hit burst`
- `hit circle`
- `hitsound`
- `in-game`
- `playstyle`
- `slider tick`
- `slider ball`
- `slider path`

---

- Use `beatmap` instead of `map`.
- Use `creator` instead of `beatmapper` or `mapper`.
- Use `mapped` instead of `beatmapped`.
<!-- https://github.com/ppy/osu-wiki/pull/561#discussion_r132090032 -->
- Use `BN` or `Beatmap Nominators` when referring to the *Beatmap Nominators*.
- Use `sign in` instead of `log in`, unless the name of a button or link uses `log in`.
- Use `sign out` instead of `log out`, unless the name of a button or link uses `log out`.
- Use `register` instead of `sign up`, unless the name of a button or link uses `sign up`.

## Abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms

Abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms must have their meaning written out upon their first occurrence. Other occurrences are optional, but done only when necessary. For example:

```markdown
The NC (Nightcore) mod is similar to the DT (Double Time) mod because both NC and DT increase the speed of the music by 50%. However, NC will change the pitch of the music and adds a clap and finish to the beat.
```

Abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms must be capitalised, with exception. For example:

- `CS` for `Circle Size`
- `AR` for `Approach Rate`
- `DT` for `Double Time`
- `SBS` for `Storyboard Scripting`

---

Use `e.g.` for "for example" and `i.e.` for "that is".

---

Abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms should not be pluralised. For example:

```markdown
Avoid: BNs can nominate your beatmapset.

Do:    Members of the BN (Beatmap Nominators) can nominate your beatmapset.
```

## Date and time

### Date formatting

*For date formatting, see [Wikipedia's Manual of Style on Date formatting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Formats)*

Date formatting must be consistent throughout the entire article.

### Time formatting

Time formatting must be done using the following format:

```markdown
HH:MM TIMEZONE
```

Time is written in 24-hour format and any single digits must be prefixed with a zero. The timezone must be written immediately after the time and should be in UTC+0 for global events or in the timezone of the event for smaller events. Use `UTC` instead of `GMT`.

Bad examples:

```markdown
3:30 PM UTC
22:30 (UTC+7)
11:30
```

Good examples:

```markdown
15:30 UTC
22:30 UTC+7
11:30 UTC-4
```

`UTC` (without an offset) is implied to be `UTC+0`. Either one may be used, but usage must be consistent. UTC with a 0 offset must use a plus symbol (`+`).

### Date and time formatting

When both date and time are used together, the date must be written first followed by the time. The time must be in between round brackets (`(` and `)`). For example:

Bad examples:

```markdown
October 25, 2016 at 11:45 UTC
October 25, 2016 11:45 UTC
```

Good example:

```markdown
October 25, 2016 (11:45 UTC)
```

## Serial comma

*Note: The serial comma is also known as the "Oxford comma" or the "Harvard comma".*

The serial comma must be used.

## Contractions

Contraction usage depends on the type of article that is being written. Formal articles should not use contractions.

## Perspective

`player`, `user`, `skinner`, `storyboarder`, and `creator` should be when referring to the reader or another person. `they`, `them`, `their`, and `theirs` may also be used when needed.

`you` and `your` should be avoided. `I` must not be used. `we`, `he` or `his`, and `she` or `her` must not be used (see above for other terms).
