# Registration

*Warning: Having more than one osu! user account at any time is an infringement against the [osu! rules](/wiki/Rules)!*

1. After [installing](/wiki/Installation) osu! and running it, osu! will prompt you to sign in or register. Assuming that you're here because you need an account, click `Create an account`.

2. Fill out all of the fields in the form.
   - For the username field, there is a maximum of 15 characters; of which can only be alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`), underscores (`_`), square brackets, (`[` and `]`), dashes (`-`), and spaces (` `).
   - For the email address field, use your email. This is used to reset your password and to send you verification codes when needed, so don't use a throw away email.
   - For the password field, use a password that is at least 8 characters long.
3. Once this is completed, click `1. Create my account!`. You will be automatically signed in.

## What's next?

Don't forget to read the [rules](/wiki/Rules) very carefully!

Once that is done, you are now ready to start your rhythm adventure! You can [add beatmaps](/wiki/Installation#adding-beatmapsets) to play, [make a skin](/wiki/Skinning), or [make a beatmap](/wiki/Beatmapping). You could also stop by and say "Hi" in the [Introductions subforum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/8).

If you need further in-game help, you can ask in the `#help` [Internet Relay Chat](/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) (IRC) channel by opening the chat console (press `F8` or `F9` in-game) then type `/join help`. You could also post your question in the [Help subforum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/5).

## Troubleshooting

### I receive some sort of server-side error when trying to play online!

**This can happen if you are using a shared internet connection, a proxy, or VPN.**

Try using another proxy or VPN provider - if all else fails, send in a support ticket via mail to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh).

If you are not using any of the above, then you will need to send in a support ticket, as your connection has likely been blacklisted in error.

Tor or networks associated with the Tor relay will not connect to the game servers for the most part. This is to avoid malicious use.
