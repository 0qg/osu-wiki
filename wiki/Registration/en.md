# Registration

*Warning: Having more than one osu! user account at any time is an infringement against the [osu! rules](/wiki/Rules)!*

1.  After [installing](/wiki/installation) osu! and running it, osu! will prompt you to sign in or register. Assuming that you're here because you need an account, click `Create an account` and keep osu! opened. This should open the [Create Account](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/register) web page.
2.  Fill out all of the fields in the form then press `Continue`.
    -   For the username field, there is a maximum of 15 characters; of which can only be alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`), underscores (`_`), square brackets, (`[` and `]`), dashes (`-`), and spaces (` `).
    -   For the email address field, use your email. This is used to reset your password and to send you verification codes when needed, so don't use a throw away email.
    -   For the password field, use a password that is at least 8 characters long.
3.  Once this is completed, go back to osu! and sign in.

## What's next?

Before you begin, don't forget to read the [rules](/wiki/Rules/) very carefully!

Once that is done, you are now ready to start your rhythm adventure! You can [add beatmaps](/wiki/installation#adding-beatmapsets) to play, [make a skin](/wiki/skinning), or [make a beatmap](/wiki/beatmapping).

If you need further in-game help, you can join the `#help` [IRC](/wiki/IRC) (Internet Relay Chat) channel and ask there or post your question in the [Help subforum](/community/forums/5).
