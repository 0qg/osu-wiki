	- There will be warning arrows when it is your turn and the combo will be in colour until your combo ends.
	- You can adjust your own combo colour at Match Setup.
- **Everyone must do the spinner regardless whether it's their turn or not.**
	- Refusal or unable to complete the spinner will break the current combo count.
- If a player quits, Auto will take over the "Quit" player.

	- If the teammate in question did not use [SD][Sudden Death wikilink], the beatmap will continue.
	- If the user(assume you) of [SD][Sudden Death wikilink] made a mistake, the _actual effect will happen_, causing everyone to be kicked to results screen immediately.

## Multiplayer Results
Players will be directed here after the beatmap is completed unless stated otherwise.

### Overall result rule
- **If you received a "Failed" statement, your score and accuracy will automatically not be counted as ranked score at all even after "revival".**
- **If "Free Mod" is enabled by Host, score differences may occur depending on mods used.**
- **Despite there is no Online score leader-board, your ranked score will still be counted as legitimate ranked entry.**
- Your result will not be shown at the Local scoreboard. The only way to see it is by Online Ranking scoreboard (assuming Multi's score is higher)
	- The exception to the rule is Tag Co-Op and Tag Team VS (Both are unranked), where your score is considered unrankable.
- You cannot retry the beatmap but you can export your replay by pressing [F2] (Will not contain the Multi-play elements).
	- The exception to the rule is Tag Co-Op and Tag Team VS (Both are unranked), where the replay cannot be saved.
