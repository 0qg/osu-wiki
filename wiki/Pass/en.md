# Pass

A **pass** describes the completion of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) with or without the use of [mods](/wiki/Game_modifier), or the reaching of a break section with more than 50% [health](/wiki/Beatmapping/Health). In the case of reaching a break section, an indicator will display with sound to show that the player has passed the previous section.
