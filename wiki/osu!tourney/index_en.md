## What is osu!tourney?

The osu!tourney client is the official streaming client used to spectate all players in a multiplayer room simultaneously.
It is, currently, only meant to be used for world cups and might therefore be limited in its behaviour.

The client, henceforth referred to as _osu!tourney_ supports matches with 2 teams of up to 8 players each.
