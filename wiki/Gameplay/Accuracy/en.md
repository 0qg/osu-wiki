# Accuracy

Accuracy defines how accurately a player is hitting [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) on a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). This value varies from from 0 to 100%. This value fluctuates up and down while a beatmap is being played, since accuracy only takes objects hit into account. Accuracy can be seen in the top-right corner while watching a replay or playing a beatmap.
