# Slider break

**Slider break** (sometimes abbreviated as *SB*) is a term used to describe the act of breaking one's [combo](link) via a partially-completed [slider](/wiki/Hit_object/Slider). Slider breaks can occur in three different ways: missing the beginning of a slider while still completing the rest, letting go of a slider at any point of its duration, not collecting all of the slider ticks. All three wyas are collectively called a "slider break" and will all break the combo. Recieving a slider break during a play will result in a `100` being recieved and will break the combo, but will not count as a miss.

A play that has no misses, but contains one or more slider breaks will result in an S grade (or Silver S) being recieved, assuming that all [Accuracy](/wiki/Accuracy) requirements have been met to recieve in an S grade.
