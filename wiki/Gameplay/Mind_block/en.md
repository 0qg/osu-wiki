# Mind block

**Mind block** is a term used to describe when a player repeatedly fails or misses on previously easy sections of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps), often as a result of retrying said beatmap repeatedly and without break. The term is called "mind block" because the event that it describes creates the sensation that the player's brain (mind) has been "blocked" from successfully obtaining a full combo.

## Causes

Mind block is often caused by heavy build-up of useless [muscle memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_memory "Wikipedia") due to the constant, repeated, and quick retrying of the same few seconds of a beatmap. In this situation, the player's mind is often bored, burned-out, or tired of doing the same patterns and hearing the same few seconds of music that it struggles to focus.

## Remedies & prevention

Many player's often rememdy mind block by taking breaks or playing different beatmaps. These two rememdies are also often used as prevention tactics, as it is the common consensus that giving the mind a break from osu! will allow it to rest, reflect, and recuperate. Likewise, many players will often switch playing beatmaps after so many attempts *before* mind block occurs to allow for better focus on other beatmaps.
