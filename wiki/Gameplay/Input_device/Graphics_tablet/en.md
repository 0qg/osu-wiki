# Graphics tablet

*See also: [Play style](/wiki/Play_style)*

A **graphics tablet**, or just *tablet*, is an input device that is intended for digital drawing and artistry, but can be used as a way to control cursor movement in [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!). The use of a graphics tablet is a very common play style in osu!standard.

Note to tablet players: the use of a Tablet PC or tablet clicks in osu! may sometimes be handled incorrectly. To fix this, enable the `OS Tablet PC support` setting in the Options menu.
