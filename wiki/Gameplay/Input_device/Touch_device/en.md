# Touch device

*See also: [Play style](/wiki/Play_style)*

A **touch device** is a device with touchscreen that allows the user to interact with the computer by using their fingers. osu! supports touch devices natively. You can use your finger to aim and click at the same time. Touch devices most often come in form of touchscreen-enabled laptops, higher-end graphics tablets, or smartphones.

If a touch device is used to play an osu!standard map, and the play result has been submitted online, a mod indicating usage of touch device would appear on the website. This is not shown in the stable client.
