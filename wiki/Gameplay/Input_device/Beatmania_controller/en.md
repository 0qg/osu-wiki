# Beatmania Controller

A **Beatmania controller** is a type of game controller that is compatible with the *[Beatmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatmania "Wikipedia")* series of games. 

Due to their nature, Beatmania controllers are most often used as input devices in [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!mania).
