# Bemani Controller

A **Bemani Controller** is a term used to describe game controllers compatible with Bemani rythem games. 
osu! supports these controllers as input devices. 
If you have a PS2 beatmania controller, 
you can use a PS2 controller to USB adaptor and bind the keys on the controller to the desired osu!mania keys. 
If you have a DJ DAO IIDX controller, it should work out of the box. 
Plug the controller in and set your key bindings in the options menu.
