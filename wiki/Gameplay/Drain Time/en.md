# Drain Time

The drain time, or *drain*, refers to the total duration of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) that requires the player to be active. Drain time does not consider breaks and unmapped parts throughout a beatmap.

Maps with very long drain times are typically referred to as marathon maps and require endurance beyond the norm in order to complete successfully.
