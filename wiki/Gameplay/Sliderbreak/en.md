# Sliderbreak

<!-- not 100% sure about this but i always thought a sliderbreak was just losing FC from a slider, didnt know it had/(still has?) other meanings -->

Sliderbreak has two meanings:

- In [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!):

  - Tapping the slider-start too early (this can cause the slider to shake)
  - Not collecting a slider tick (includes the hidden ones underneath the slider-start and slider-end).
  - Releasing the slider ball before it hits the slider-end.
    - This will not cause a miss, but instead will give the player a 100 with no combo increment.

- The case where the player does not obtain the max possible combo without missing an object.
