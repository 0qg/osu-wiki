# Fingerlock

*Not to be confused with [Notelock](/wiki/Notelock) or [Mind block](/wiki/Mind_block)*

**Fingerlock** (alternatively spelt as `finger-lock` or `finger lock`) is a term used to describe the sensation of momentarily losing control of one's fingers whilst playing osu!. Although not a term specific to osu!, the term is widely used by players to communicate frustration with plays where a player knows, when and where to press a [hit object](/wiki/Hit_object), but unexplicably just doesn't press the key, effectively creating a sensatin where said finger feels as if it is "locked" in place. Hence then name, "fingerlock."

"Fingerlock" may occasionally be refferred to as `wrist lock`, `wristlock`, `wrist-lock`.

## Causes

*Notice: fingerlock is **not** a medical condition, and any alleged "research" or commonly-understood information within the osu! community as to its cause or long-term effects is not considered to by scientific. osu! is not qualified to give medical advice; do not use the osu! wiki to diagnose medical conditions.**

Fingerlock is a common sensation that happens to many veteran osu! players. The common consensus amongst most players is that fingerlock is *generally* no cause for alarm. But if a player experiences persistent or painful fingerlock often, it is reccommended that that player see a medical proffessional, as it may be a result of underlying health.

Unfortunately, a specific cause has neither been found nor generally understood yet. Although there are few common culprits that may be cause of fingerlock: long play sessions (especicially ones that retry the same [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) over and over), bad posture/wrist position, or unneccessary strain on the wrist or fingers for extended periods of time. Regardless, most times, fingerlock will occur during a play once and then never again due to a simple hesitation or slip-up regarding reaction time.

## Remedies & prevention

Remedies "fingerlock" is often unneccessary as fingerlock typically resolves itself the second after it happens. But in cases where there is pain involved, many players will take breaks, stretch their fingers, or engage in another activity that is less dependent on said finger(s). These three rememdies are also effective prevention strategies, as doing these before fingerlock occurs can effectively prevent it. Although this is not guaranteed.
