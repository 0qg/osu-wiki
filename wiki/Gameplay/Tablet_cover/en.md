# Tablet cover

<!--See also: [Tablet](link)-->

A **tablet cover** is a special type of protective material that encases or sticks onto the surface of a graphics tablet. Tablet covers are similar to smartphone screen protectors, with the only significant difference being that they are able to have a custom image or logo in between the protective material. Although they serve the same purpose of screen protectors in that they reduce nibwear, prolong the lifespan of said tablet, and can protect the surface of the tablet from scratches. Some tablet covers can even create a surface that is more glossy, smooth, or rough, depending on the type and preferences of the user.

Tablet covers often come in a form that is almost identical to smartphone screen protectors, except for the fact that the side that sticks only uses a strip of of sticky material along the *outer edges* of the protective material. This is to avoid damage with the actual tablet surfaces material, and allows for the use of pressure sensitivity and other features for digital drawing.

Tablet covers typically range from $9 USDâ€“$50 USD, depending on the brand, quality, and material.

## DIY vs. manufactured

Many forum posts that ask about where to buy or make tablet covers often mention how easy it is to create one. Common DIY tablet covers use a variety of materials that can be found at home or in-store for relatively cheap. Whereas manufactured tablet covers often use specialized materials to reduce nibwear and last longer.

### DIY

Many players will often claim that DIY tablet covers "do the job" and are thus favorable due to their low-cost and wide accessibilty. DIY tablet covers often use materials that can easily found in most households and are often held down via tape or some heavy object.

Common DIY tablet cover materials often use one or more of the following materials:

- Book film
- Laminated paper
- Bill strips
- Glass screen protectors

Due to the nature of DIY projects, the look, durability, and (in some cases) effectiveness will always be of lesser quality compared to manufactured/store-bought items. Although, many players reccomend starting out with a DIY tablet cover to know whether or not it's right for you, and to prevent spending a large amount of money that may or may not be wasted upon losing interest in certain play styles.

### Manufactured

Manufactured or store-bought tablet covers are often made of more specialized materials that cannot be easily found or easily shaped/created in most households. Online distributors like PosR.us and Yangumasuta are popular distributors of such covers. They will often have a texture that is glossy, matte, or similar to smartphone screen protectors.

Due to the nature of manufactured items, they will always be more expensive than DIY projects, and as such, claim to promise higher quality. Many players reccomend starting out with a DIY tablet cover, but it is up to each individual whether or not they will buy or make a tablet cover.
