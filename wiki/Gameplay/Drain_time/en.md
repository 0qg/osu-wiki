# Drain time

**Drain time** refers to the total duration of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) that requires the player to be active. Drain time does not include breaks and unmapped portions of a beatmap.

Drain time originates from osu! and osu!catch's [health drain](/wiki/Beatmapping/Health_Drain) system, during which a player's health constantly drains while playing.

The beatmap info page calculates drain time (labeled "Drain length") according to the time between the start positions of first and last objects of a beatmap. If a beatmap's last object is a slider or a spinner, its labeled drain time will not include the full length of the object. Rules and guidelines related to drain time on the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) expect drain time to include the full length of a beatmap's last object.
