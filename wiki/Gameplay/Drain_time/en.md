# Drain time

**Drain time** refers to the total duration of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) that requires the player to be active. Drain time does not include breaks and unmapped portions of a beatmap.

Beatmaps with very long drain times (usually longer than 5 minutes) are typically referred to as marathon maps and require endurance beyond the norm in order to complete successfully.
