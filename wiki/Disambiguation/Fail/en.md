# Fail

**Fail** can refer to two different things:

- The incompletion of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) due to:
  - Not filling the health bar to 80% when completing a beatmap in [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko).
  - Emptying the health bar in [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch), or [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania).
  - In multiplayer this triggers an indicator to appear underneath a player's name to show that they failed the beatmap.
- The player having less than 50% [health](/wiki/Beatmapping/Health) once a break occurs. If the break is long enough, a fail sprite will appear and a sound effect will play.
  - A failed [storyboard](/wiki/Storyboard_Scripting) animation will also be played if available.
