# osu!

**osu!** stylised with a lowercase "o" can refer to three things:

- The game client which hosts all [game modes](/wiki/Game_Modes) and chat features.
- The game mode unofficially called [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!).
- An informal greeting in Japanese, originating by condensing the phrase "Ohayo gozaimasu!" (Good morning!)
  - Pronounced with a silent u ("OSS").
  - Close English equivalents include "Yo!" or "Hey!".
