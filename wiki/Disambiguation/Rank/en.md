- Synonym for a [letter grade](/wiki/Grade).
- A player's standing in online leaderboards (also known as "[player ranking](/wiki/Ranking)").
- The verb "to rank". When someone goes through the [beatmap ranking procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure), making scores achieved by anyone playing it count towards each player's player ranking.
