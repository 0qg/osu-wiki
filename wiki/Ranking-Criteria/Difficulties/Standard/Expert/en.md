In ways to push and extend the limits of beatmapping, Expert was invented/created to be beatmaps *like* [Insane](Insane "wikilink") but go beyond.

It could be the extra *5th* difficulty (if beatmaps are formatted in ![E|link=Easy (Difficulty)](Easy-s.png "fig:E|link=Easy (Difficulty)")![N|link=Normal](Diffeasy.png "fig:N|link=Normal")![H|link=Hard](Diffhard.png "fig:H|link=Hard")![I|link=Insane](Insane-s.png "fig:I|link=Insane")![X|link=Expert](Diffexpert.png "fig:X|link=Expert")) or the *4th* (if beatmaps are formatted in ![N|link=Normal](Diffeasy.png "fig:N|link=Normal")![H|link=Hard](Diffhard.png "fig:H|link=Hard")![I|link=Insane](Insane-s.png "fig:I|link=Insane")![X|link=Expert](Diffexpert.png "fig:X|link=Expert")). These maps, like [Insane](Insane "wikilink"), quote, "generally exemplifications of the mapper's skill, and are the difficulties where creativity can be easily shown."

On the osu!beatmap listing page (for example: [Rise Against - The Good Left Undone (Extreme)](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/774564)), one may tell it is an Expert map with this icon: ![](Diffexpert.png "fig:Diffexpert.png")

Characteristically, expert difficulties are difficult maps, usually featuring both streams and jumps. A map receives the expert icon when its star rating reaches more than 5.25 stars.

An issue with Expert maps, like Insane maps, is that they can easily be [Overmapped](Overmapped "wikilink") to increase the map's difficulty.

Settings
--------

*Note: this is only a <u>general suggestion</u>. The difficulty setting will vary depending on the song itself and mapper's own style.*

Also note: in most cases it's the [mapping](mapping "wikilink"), not the [Song Setup](Song_Setup "wikilink"), but doing this (or similar) is a step of the way!''
