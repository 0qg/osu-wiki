# Restricted mode

**Restricted mode** is a state that is automatically applied to accounts that are suspected of breaking the [Terms of Service](https://osu.ppy.sh/legal/terms). Submitted scores of gameplay will be hidden from the [leaderboards](/wiki/Ranking) as a result of this.

For more info, see [What is "restricted" mode, exactly?](/wiki/Help_Centre#restriction).
