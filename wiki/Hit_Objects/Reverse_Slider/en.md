# Reverse Slider

A *reverse slider* is a [hit object](/wiki/Hit_Objects) in [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), which acts exactly like a [slider](/wiki/Hit_Objects/Slider) with the added benefit of reversing itself on completion. This is indicated in gameplay with a reverse arrow where the sliderend would otherwise be. Sliders can be reversed by clicking and dragging the sliderend in the timeline of the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor). This can be done multiple times to the same slider to create a slider with multiple reverses.
