# Sliderhead

*Sliderheads* are the starting points of all [sliders](/wiki/Hit_Objects/Slider) found in [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps). Once a sliderhead has been clicked the player has to follow along the [sliderbody](/wiki/Hit_Objects/Sliderbody) with their input devise, until the [sliderend](/wiki/Hit_Objects/Sliderend) is reached and they can release their button. The colour of sliderheads is determined by the combo colours used by the mappers of a beatmap.
