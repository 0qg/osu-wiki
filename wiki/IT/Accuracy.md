There are three types of accuracy - \[1\] per [beatmap](IT:Beatmap "wikilink")'s accuracy, \[2\] one's overall accuracy, and \[3\] [pp](IT:Pp "wikilink")'s accuracy.

In simple terms, beatmap's accuracy is dependent on [Hit-scores](IT:Score "wikilink") gained, overall's accuracy dependent on each submitted best online score's accuracy, and pp's accuracy is dependent on submitted online score's accuracy which is eligible for pp gain.

\_\_TOC\_\_ Accuracy is calculated by the following formulas:-

Standard Mode
-------------

In Standard, accuracy is calculated by weighting the judgement gained on each note by its value and dividing by the maximum possible amount. In other words:-

| colspan=2|Accuracy = Total points of hits / (Total number of hits \* 300) |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Total points of hits                                                      |
| Total number of hits                                                      |

For reference: 300 = 6/6, 100 = 2/6, 50 = 1/6, Miss = 0/6.

Taiko Mode
----------

In Taiko mode, the song accuracy is calculated by sum of all note accuracy divided by number of notes. A GREAT (良) counts as 100%, a GOOD (可) as 50% (half) and a MISS/BAD (不可) as 0% (which breaks the combo). Drumrolls and spinners do not influence the accuracy.

| colspan=2|Accuracy = Total points of hits / (Total number of hits \* 300) |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Total points of hits                                                      |
| Total number of hits                                                      |

Catch the Beat Mode
-------------------

In CtB, the song accuracy is calculated as the number of non-spinner objects collected divided by the total number of non-spinner objects; fruits, large drops and small drops all have the same value.

| colspan=2|Accuracy = Total numbers of fruits caught / Total number of fruits |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Condition                                                                    |

osu!mania Mode
--------------

Accuracy is calculated similarly to standard in this mode.

| colspan=2|Accuracy = Total points of hits / (Total number of hits \* 300) |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Total points of hits                                                      |
| Total number of hits                                                      |

Note that MAX and 300 are both worth the maximum for calculating accuracy, despite a MAX being worth more in terms of score than a 300.

**Notes**

-   The above four values are not saved and will disappear after you close osu!. You can only see them again by watching a saved replay.
-   Due to the way the Double Time and Half Time mods are implemented, the Error and Unstable Rate values will be multiplied by the same factor as the song. To get the true values when playing DT, divide the results by 1.5. Similarly, multiply the results by 1.33 when playing HT.
