## Ranking process

_See also: [Beatmap Ranking Procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_Ranking_Procedure)._

The ranking process of a beatmap (a difficulty that the player can play) consists of [beatmapping](/wiki/beatmapping/#getting-started) and [modding](/wiki/modding/#getting-started).

Beatmapping is the process where a creator creates a beatmap. This process includes: selecting music, timing and mapping the beatmap, and testing the beatmap; and could include: adding a video, [storyboarding](/wiki/storyboarding/#getting-started), and/or [skinning](/wiki/skinning/#getting-started). All of those can be done by yourself or with other users, sometimes referred to _storyboarders_, _skinners_, and/or _guest creators_, depending on what they do.

Modding is the process where users review (or commonly called "mod") a creator's beatmap in the pending (or work in progress/help) stage. Modding plays a big role in quality control because this allows creators to fix issues with their beatmap.

## osu!wiki - How you can help!

Since 26. August 2016, the osu!wiki had moved to a GitHub repository. After this change, the workflow of the osu!wiki has dramatically changed. All contributions will now go through the osu-wiki GitHub repository and will be reviewed before becoming part of the osu!wiki. At this time, contributing to the osu!wiki will require more time and slightly more effort to make your changes actually happen.

To get started, see the [osu!wiki Contribution Guide](/wiki/owcg).
