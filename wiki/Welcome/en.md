## Ranking process

_See also: [Beatmap Ranking Procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_Ranking_Procedure)._

The ranking process of a beatmap (the difficulty of a song that the player can play) consists of [beatmapping](/wiki/beatmapping/#getting-started) and [modding](/wiki/modding/#getting-started).

Beatmapping is the process of a creator creating a beatmap. This process includes: selecting music, timing and mapping the beatmap, and testing the beatmap. It might also include: adding a video, adding a [storyboard](/wiki/storyboarding/#getting-started), and/or adding a [custom skin](/wiki/skinning/#getting-started). All of those can be done by the creator alone or with other users, sometimes referred to as _storyboarders_, _skinners_, and/or _guest creators_, depending on what they do.

Modding is the process of users reviewing (or commonly called "modding") a creator's beatmap in the pending (or work in progress/help) stage. Modding plays a big role in quality control because this allows creators to fix issues with their beatmap.
