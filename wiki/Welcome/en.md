## Beatmapping and modding process

_See also: [Beatmapping](/wiki/Beatmapping/#getting-started) and [Modding](/wiki/Modding/#getting-started)._

Beatmapping and modding is a primary ecoflow of how osu! works. Beatmapping requires a creator to map out a beatmap; to which, it can then be modded by a modder.

There are many pieces of beatmapping, such as adding a video, [storyboarding](/wiki/storyboarding/#getting-started), [skinning](/wiki/skinning/#getting-started), testing the beatmap, and actually mapping the beatmap. All of these can by done by yourself or other creators, sometimes refered to storyboarders and skinners respectively.

## osu!wiki - How you can help!

Since 26. August 2016, the osu!wiki is now a GitHub repository (rather than MediaWiki). There are many factors for this to occur but notably, the workflow of the osu!wiki has dramatically changed. All contributions will now go through the osu-wiki GitHub repository and will be reviewed before actually becoming part of the osu!wiki. In this state, contributing to the osu!wiki will require more time and slightly more effort to make your changes actually happen.

To get started, see the [osu!wiki Contribution Guide](/wiki/osu!wiki_Contribution_Guide).
