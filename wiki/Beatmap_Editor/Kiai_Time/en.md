# Kiai Time

*For regulations surrounding kiai time, see the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).*

**Kiai Time** is a term given for a "special" timing section to help emphasize a part of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). A player can tell if a part of a beatmap has a kiai timing section by seeing added visual effects such as flashing beats, flying stars, and fountains.

While kiai time is active all [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) will flash at the rhythm of the [main beat](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timing) and stars will explode from the cursor when a [hit circle](/wiki/Hit_Objects) is hit or will fall from the cursor when a [slider](/wiki/Hit_Objects) or [spinner](/wiki/Hit_Objects) is followed.

## Beatmapping

Kiai time is most commonly used for the "strongest part of a song" which usually is the chorus. Since kiai sections are the strongest part of a song it makes sense that they are slightly more challenging than the rest of the mapset to follow the song.
