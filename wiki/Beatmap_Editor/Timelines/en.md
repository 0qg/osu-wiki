|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| "+"/"-" buttons at left                                                                                                                                     |

| Centre                                                                                                                                                      |
| Keyframe Control                                                                                                                                            |
| This will be used for **adding anchor points (Start/End points).** It works pretty much the same way as bookmarks. The buttons are just under the timeline. |
| "+"/"-" buttons                                                                                                                                             |
| "|&lt;" / "&gt;|" buttons                                                                                                                                   |

If there is a transformation, that transformation is lighted with it's colour and will have two separated half-lines that determines the duration. Full white line determines the transformation switching points (eg going up -&gt; going down).

Timing
---------

*Location: Top @ [Timing](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timing) tab*

![Timing Timeline](TT.jpg "Timing Timeline")

| Timing Timeline         |

| "+"/"-" buttons at left |
| Centre                  |
| Flag colours            |
| White                   |
| Blue                    |

At right, it shows **Time Signature script (known as "Meter")** and **Metronome set**. The meter's **4:2** means **4th measure and 2nd beat of the song**. The **Metronome set plays the BPM beat** and **doubles as a helper to estimate a BPM value.**
