# Beatmaps Packs

_Main page: [Beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps)_

Beatmaps packs, as the title suggests, are a `.zip` files containing beatmaps.
The name of the pack is based on what they contain (e.g. `Approved Beatmap Pack #7` would only contain [approved](#approved) beatmaps).
It is worth noting that the most packs are:

- Roughly either ~100MB (Taiko/osu!mania) or ~200MB (-/Approved)
- Always contain videos (if included)
- The beatmaps are either in the form of `.zip` or `.osz` file

## Categories

Beatmaps packs split into 4 categories:

| Category | Beatmap types |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Standard | Ranked or Approved songs |
| Chart | Fortnightly Chart challenge songs |
| Theme | General theme of the songs |
| Artist/Album | Based on Artist/Album |

## Obtaining Every Beatmap

This is for those who really want to *fully complete your song list* (and not just download your favorite songs).

Keep in mind that you will need quite a lot of digital space to storage these beatmaps.
As beatmap packs (and torrents) also downloads with the video and other beatmap skinable elements.

### Beatmap Pack Listing

Download all the (-/Approved/Taiko/osu!mania) beatmaps packs from the **Standard** category and nowhere else.
The (-/Approved/Taiko/osu!mania) beatmaps packs will contain all the songs in the other 3 categories.

The beatmaps packs can be found and downloaded from: [osu! Beatmaps Packs page](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/packlist).

### Torrenting

*Notice: Torrenting osu!beatmaps seems to of had died off approximately 2 years ago and counting... (within the border of osu! and it's forums)*

- [Beatmap-Torrents](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/147478)
  - [HiraOsu! - Torrents](http://osu.hiramiya.me/torrents.htm) by [Hiramiya](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/1313441)

These torrents contain the 10, 100, 200 or 300 packs.
As soon as there are 400 packs available, the torrent should be avaliable.

A rough estimation of how many hard disk space (and your connection quota) you will need is around ~71 GB.
