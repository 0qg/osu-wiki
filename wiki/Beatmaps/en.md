# Beatmaps

*Not to be confused with [Difficulties](/wiki/Difficulties).*

A beatmap is a set of difficulties in [osu!](/wiki/osu!_glossary). Beatmaps consist of a song, a background image and multiple [hit objects](/wiki/hit_objects) in sync with the beat. They can also include a video, and/or [storyboard](/wiki/storyboards). Beatmaps are shared through a system called [BSS](/wiki/BSS) (Beatmap Submission System). After beatmaps have been shared, they will show up on the [Beatmaps Listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) page on the website where they can be downloaded and favourited.

You can also find beatmaps in [beatmap packs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs) or through osu!direct.<!--TODO: Add link once osu!supporter article has been written-->

## Beatmap Categories

Beatmaps are split into 5 categories depending on their recent activity, nomination status, or favorites. The categories are:

- Graveyard
- Work in Progress/Pending
- Qualified
- Ranked
- Loved

### Graveyard

Graveyarded beatmaps are beatmaps that have been abandoned by their creator. Beatmaps are moved to the Graveyard category—from the [Pending](#pending) category—automatically once they haven't been updated for 4 weeks. Graveyarded beatmaps do not have leaderboards and will not affect user statistics. However, they can still be downloaded and played like normally. Graveyarded beatmaps use the question mark icon (![Question mark icon](/wiki/shared/status/graveyard.png)) in the song selection screen.

Once a beatmap is graveyarded, it can be revived (i.e. bring it back to the pending category). This can be done by updating the beatmap via [BSS](/wiki/BSS) (Beatmap Submission System).

### Work in Progress and Pending

Work in Progress (commonly initialised as *WIP*) and Pending are the two standard categories beatmaps are put into on initial submission. Beatmaps in these categories can move to the [Qualified](#qualified) category upon nomination by at least two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators). This usually includes a great amount of feedback from [modders](/wiki/modders) through [modding](/wiki/modding). Work in Progress and Pending beatmaps do not have leaderboards and will not affect user statistics. Work in progress and Pending beatmaps use the question mark icon (![Question mark icon](/wiki/shared/status/pending.png)) in the song selection screen.

Inactive beatmaps that have been in this category for 4 weeks are automatically moved into the [Graveyard](#graveyard) category.

### Qualified

Qualified beatmaps are in the last stage of the [Beatmap ranking procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure). These beatmaps have been nominated by at least two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators) who have made sure that the beatmap meets the standards of the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/ranking_criteria).

Beatmaps stay qualified for 7 days before they enter the [Ranked]((#ranked)) section permanently and become endorsed as official content. This period serves as a last line of defense in which any flaws and mistakes that might have slipped through can be fixed. In this period, beatmaps can be disqualified, changed and re-qualified without reseting the time it takes for the beatmap to become ranked. The Qualified section is in that sense, the last step before being considered a fully fledged beatmap. Qualified beatmaps use the check icon (![Check icon](/wiki/shared/status/qualified.png)) in the song selection screen. Qualified beatmaps have leaderboards. Though, upon playing the beatmap a dialogue will display, noting that:

- No [performance points (pp)](/wiki/Performance_Points) will be awarded.
- All scores will be deleted when the status is changed.

### Ranked

Ranked beatmaps are endorsed as official content, in the sense that they have reached or surpassed the standards of the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/ranking_criteria). This is to ensure that most players can expect a certain kind of standard while playing them. Ranked beatmaps allow other players to compete on leaderboards and to gain performance points from setting scores on them. Once a beatmap has achieved ranked status, its status cannot be altered again (except for extraordinary cases). Ranked beatmaps use the double upwards chevron icon (![Double upwards chevron icon](/wiki/shared/status/ranked.png)) in the song selection screen.

### Loved

*For history of the Loved category, see: [History of Loved](/wiki/Beatmaps/History_of_Loved).*

Loved beatmaps may not meet the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria), but are *loved* by the community and thus are regularly added based on community votes in [Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). Loved beatmaps use the heart icon (![Heart icon](/wiki/shared/status/loved.png)) in the song selection screen. Before the beatmap begins playing, a dialogue will display, noting that:

- No [performance points (pp)](/wiki/Performance_Points) will be awarded.
- All scores will be deleted if the creator updates the beatmap.

For a beatmap to be Loved, it must go through the [community voting process](/wiki/Project_Loved#moving-a-beatmap-to-loved).
