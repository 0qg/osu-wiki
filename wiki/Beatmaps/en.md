# Beatmaps

Beatmaps, or _maps_ for short, are game levels in [osu!](/wiki/osu!_glossary), like the stages in the [DS games](/wiki/Glossary/#ds-games).
In their most basic form, a beatmap have a song and various [hit objects](/wiki/hit_objects) placed according to the rhythm of the music.
They can also have a background image, video, and/or [storyboard](/wiki/storyboards).

Creators of beatmaps are called beatmappers or mappers for short.
Beatmaps are uploaded for everyone to play with using the [BSS](/wiki/BSS), and are then [modded](/wiki/modded).
Once a beatmap is deemed good enough, it is [ranked](#ranked) or if fulfilling certain criteria, [approved](#approved).

You can find beatmaps in the [Beatmaps Listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) page on osu!web.

## Beatmap Statuses

Both ranked and approved beatmaps requires approval from two  [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators).
They can influence the stats on a player's profile which is what makes them different from a [pending](#pending) or [graveyarded](#graveyard) beatmap.

### Ranked

Ranked beatmaps use the double upwards chevron icon (![Double upwards chevron icon](/wiki/shared/ranked.gif)) in the song select screen.

These beatmaps ideally fulfill all of the [ranking criteria](/wiki/ranking_criteria).
This is to ensure that most players can expect a certain kind of standard while playing them.

### Approved

Approved beatmaps use the check icon (![Check icon](/wiki/shared/approved.gif)) in the song select screen.

The approved status is typically for songs that are over 5:00 minutes in length, measured with the total [drain time](/wiki/drain_time) of a map.
Most approved maps don't have an [easy](/wiki/easy) or [normal](/wiki/normal) difficulty.
However, some mappers may uploaded them as separate mapsets with identical songs while some are included inside a ranked song, containing ranked maps.

### Qualified

Qualified beatmaps use the check icon (![Check icon](/wiki/shared/qualified.gif)) in the song select screen.

These beatmaps are the last stage of the beatmapping and modding process.
Before the map start when playing, a dialoge will display, noting the status of the beatmap will cause:

- No [pp](/wiki/pp) will be awarded.
- All scores will be deleted when the status is changed.
  - If the status is changed to ranked, approved, or back to pending; all scores will be wiped!

When a beatmap is qualified, it has passed the [ranking criteria](/wiki/ranking_criteria) and has been checked by two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators).
Qualified beatmaps is the last line of defense as they are required to be in this state for one week before becoming [ranked](#ranked) or [approved](#approved) permanently.

During the one week duration, however, [QATs](/wiki/QAT) are allowed to write up issues with these beatmaps.
If this happens, the mapset's state will go back to pending and the process starts over again.

### Loved

Loved beatmaps use the heart icon (![Heart icon](/wiki/shared/loved.gif)) in the song select screen.

These beatmaps are regularly be adding maps based on community votes, but (unnecessarily) does not meet the [ranking criteria](/wiki/ranking_criteria).
Before the map start when playing, a dialoge will display, noting the status of the beatmap will cause:

- No [pp](/wiki/pp) will be awarded.
- All scores will be deleted when the creator updates the map.

This status will give these beatmaps a leaderboard.

To get a map in the loved status, see the forum post [Get your map Loved!](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/549835).

### Pending

_See also: [Beatmap Ranking Procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_Ranking_Procedure)_

Pending beatmaps use the question mark icon (![Question mark icon](/wiki/shared/pending.gif)) in the song select screen.

A beatmap with a pending status is usually waiting to be [modded](/wiki/modded).
[Mappers](/wiki/Mappers) must seek for [modders](/wiki/modders) from the community and at least two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators) to get their mapset out of this state.

Inactive beatmaps that have been in this category for 4 weeks are automatically moved into the [graveyard](#graveyard) state.

All pending beatmaps do not affect user statistics.

### Graveyard

Graveyarded beatmaps use the question mark icon (![Question mark icon](/wiki/shared/graveyard.gif)) in the song select screen.

These maps were initally [pending](#pending), but are moved to this status because they have not been updated or its thread post was inactive for 4 weeks.
These maps cannot be updated until the [mapper](/wiki/mapper) revives it by clicking the `Revive Beatmap` link in their profile, under the category `Beatmaps`.

All graveyarded beatmaps do not affect user statistics.

For the sake of saving digital space for newer and future beatmaps, *osu!* will purge graveyarded beatmaps if they have been in this state for a long period of time.
