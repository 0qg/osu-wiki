# Beatmaps

*Not to be confused with [Difficulties](/wiki/Difficulties).*

A beatmap is a set of difficulties in [osu!](/wiki/osu!_glossary). Beatmaps consist of a song, a background image and multiple [hit objects](/wiki/hit_objects) in sync with the beat. They can also include a video, and/or [storyboard](/wiki/storyboards).

Beatmaps are shared through a system called [BSS](/wiki/BSS) (Beatmap Submission System). After beatmaps have been shared they will show up on the [Beatmaps Listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) page on osu! web where they can be downloaded and favorited.

You can also find beatmaps in [beatmap packs](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/packs) or through osu!direct.<!--TODO: Add link once osu!supporter article has been written-->

## Beatmap Categories

Beatmaps are split into 5 different categories depending on their recent activity, nomination status and/or favorites. The categories are:

- Graveyard
- Work in Progress/Pending
- Qualified
- Ranked
- Loved

### Graveyard

Graveyarded beatmaps are beatmaps that have been abandoned by their creator. Beatmaps are moved to the Graveyard from the [pending](#pending) category automatically once they haven't been updated for 4 weeks. Graveyarded beatmaps do not have leaderboards and will not affect user statistics, but can still be downloaded and played like normally.

Once a beatmap is graveyarded it can be revived (put back into pending) by updating the beatmap through the [BSS](/wiki/BSS) (Beatmap Submission System)

Graveyarded beatmaps use the question mark icon (![Question mark icon](/wiki/shared/status/graveyard.png)) in the song selection screen.

### Pending/Work in Progress

Pending/Work in Progress (WIP) are the two standard categories beatmaps are put into on initial submission. Beatmaps in these categories can move to the qualified category upon nomination by at least two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators). This usually includes a great amount of feedback from [modders](/wiki/modders) through [modding](/wiki/modding). Pending/WIP beatmaps do not have leaderboards and will not affect user statistics.

Inactive beatmaps that have been in this category for 4 weeks are automatically moved into the [graveyard](#graveyard) status.

Pending/WIP beatmaps use the question mark icon (![Question mark icon](/wiki/shared/status/pending.png)) in the song selection screen.

### Qualified

Qualified beatmaps are in the last stage of the [Beatmap ranking procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure). These beatmaps have been nominated by at least two [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators) who have made sure that the beatmap meets the standards of the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/ranking_criteria).

Beatmaps stay qualified for a period of approximately 7 days before they enter the [Ranked]((#ranked)) section permanently and become endorsed as official content. This period serves as a last line of defense in which any flaws and mistakes that might have slipped through can be fixed. In this period, beatmaps can be disqualified, changed and re-qualified without reseting the time it takes for the beatmap to become ranked. The Qualified section is in that sense, the last step before being considered a fully fledged beatmap.

Qualified beatmaps have leaderboards. Though, upon playing the beatmap a dialogue will display, noting that:

- No [performance points (pp)](/wiki/Performance_Points) will be awarded.
- All scores will be deleted when the status is changed.

Qualified beatmaps use the check icon (![Check icon](/wiki/shared/status/qualified.png)) in the song selection screen.

### Ranked

Ranked beatmaps are endorsed as official content, in the sense that they have reached or surpassed the standards of the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/ranking_criteria). This is to ensure that most players can expect a certain kind of standard while playing them. Ranked beatmaps allow other players to compete on leaderboards and to gain performance points from setting scores on them. Once a beatmap has achieved Ranked status, its status cannot be altered again (except for extraordinary cases).

Ranked beatmaps use the double upwards chevron icon (![Double upwards chevron icon](/wiki/shared/status/ranked.png)) in the song selection screen.

### Loved

*For history of the Loved category, see: [History of Loved](/wiki/Beatmaps/History_of_Loved).*

Loved beatmaps may not meet the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria), but are *loved* by the community and thus are regularly added based on community votes in [Project Loved](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/120). Before the beatmap begins playing, a dialogue will display, noting that:

- No [performance points (pp)](/wiki/Performance_Points) will be awarded.
- All scores will be deleted if the creator updates the beatmap.

For a beatmap to be Loved, it must go through the [community voting process](/wiki/Project_Loved#moving-a-beatmap-to-loved).

Loved beatmaps use the heart icon (![Heart icon](/wiki/shared/status/loved.png)) in the song selection screen.
