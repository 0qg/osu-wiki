## Beatmap description

**Beatmap descriptions** are small areas under a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps)'s page that give players information about said beatmap using [BBCode](/wiki/BBCode). Most [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmaps#ranked) beatmaps use at least one image, a number (depending on how many beatmaps the creator has Ranked), and a difficulty section.

## Good beatmap descriptions

*Notice: In order to get a beatmap ranked, it is recommended you have a good beatmap description, but this is not required.*

A good beatmap description would include:

- A list of all the guest difficulties and their creators
- An "18+ lyrics" warning (if neccessary)
- Information that would help a player decide whether they want to download the beatmap or not
- An edits list or changelog

### Images

Many beatmap descriptions contain at least one image. To learn know how to add a image using BBCode, check out the [BBCode article](/wiki/BBCode#image). Also, make sure you have the link of the image you want to put in the beatmap description.

### Difficulty sections

A difficulty section is located in a beatmap description, usually this section has a list of all the guest difficulties and their creators, this is mostly used to showcase the difficulties of a beatmap. Difficulty sections usually have images for the icons.

#### Difficulty icons

The difficulty icons can be found in the [Difficulties article](/wiki/Difficulties).
