# Technical maps

<!-- Line to be added eventually: *Not to be confused with [Slider Art](link) -->


*Notice: For the purposes of this article, the term "tech map" will be treated as an umbrella term that include all of these definitions. Though please keep in-mind that no clear, "official" verdict has been made and the wiki intends to reflect that.*

**Technical maps** (often shorted to "tech map") is a term that does not have a clear, agreed-upon definition amongst the osu! community. Depending on the user, "tech map" can be as broad as a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) that simply contains non-generic beatmap [patterns](link) and/or [slider](/wiki/Hit_Objects/Slider) shapes that have a hard "flow," or as specific as a beatmap that is dense in [object](/wiki/Hit_Objects) count, high in intensity, and irregular slider shapes that quickly and drastically change speeds (often at high intensity). 

Tech maps are most often associated with song genres that offer complex and fast-paced sounds such as drum-and-bass, dubstep, and drumstep as they often allow for the mapper to explore each and every individual sound in detail to the beatmap's advantage. Though this is not required.

Many players claim that tech maps are unfair due to the increase in difficulty deriving mostly or soley from the confusing layout of the sliders. Likewise, this means that they are not very popular for gaining large amounts of pp at once due to the way the current system works and how it undervalues sliders of this nature.
