# Technical maps

<!-- Line to be added eventually: *Not to be confused with [Slider Art](link) -->

**Technical maps** (often shorted to "tech map") describe a very broad range of [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps), depending on the defintion. Most commonly, they describe beatmaps that contain many large, difficult-to-read, almost nonsencial, and fast [sliders](/wiki/Hit_Objects#slider). Being most often associated with an "unfair" and dramatic increase in difficulty and low [performance points (pp)](/wiki/Performance_Points). Popular tech maps like (placeholder) and (placeholder) are good examples of this.

Generally speaking, the broadest definition of a "tech map" would be beatmap that is overall high intensity, dense in object (more specifcally "[hit object](/wiki/Hit_Objects)" count, and large amounts of uncommon sliders. But this definition is rarely used. 

Tech maps are often associated with [dubstep](placeholder) and "wub" music. This is most often because the feeling of the sliders nonsensical design and dubstep's artificial/unnatural sound. They may also include slider art. Though these are not requirements for a beatmap to be called a tech map.

Many players claim that tech maps are unfair due to the increase in difficulty deriving mostly or soley from the confusing layout of the sliders. Likewise, this means that they are not very popular for gaining large amounts of pp at once due to the way the current system works and how it undervalues sliders of this nature.
