# Technical maps

<!-- Line to be added eventually: *Not to be confused with [Slider Art](link) -->

**Technical maps** (often shorted to "tech map") is a term that is most commonly used to describe [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps) that are characterized by a heavy use of extended [sliders](/wiki/Hit_Objects#slider) and slider velocity changes in its design. Many tech maps are also known to exhibit irregular slider shapes and unconventional mapping techniques on a frequent basis throughout the beatmap. Though this is not a requirement for beatmap to be considered a "tech map." Popular tech maps like (Syzygia)[https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1085144#osu/2269224] and (Calling)[https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/673878#osu/1426038] are good examples of this.

Tech maps are most often associated with song genres that offer complex and fast-paced sounds such as drum-and-bass, dubstep, and drumstep as they often allow for the mapper to explore each and every individual sound in detail to the beatmap's advantage. Though this is not required.

Generally speaking, the broadest definition of a "tech map" would be beatmap that is overall high intensity, dense in object (more specifcally "[hit object](/wiki/Hit_Objects)" count, and large amounts of uncommon sliders. But this definition is rarely used. 

Many players claim that tech maps are unfair due to the increase in difficulty deriving mostly or soley from the confusing layout of the sliders. Likewise, this means that they are not very popular for gaining large amounts of pp at once due to the way the current system works and how it undervalues sliders of this nature.
