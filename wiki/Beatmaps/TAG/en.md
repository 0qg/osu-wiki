# TAG

**TAG** is a term used to describe a [multiplayer](/wiki/multi) game mode named [Tag Coop or Tag Team Vs](/wiki/Multi#tag-coop-/-tag-team-vs), where players try to complete a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) cooperatively. Beatmaps that are specifically designed for this mode are usually referred to as **TAG beatmaps/difficulties**.

In these modes, each player is responsible for one [comboset](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo). Throughout the song, players switch between each comboset. For this reason, TAG beatmaps are designed in such a way that their combosets are mapped much farther apart and more complex than the usual, making it nearly impossible to play by a single player.

TAG difficulties are usually denoted by the use of the term "TAG" in the beatmap difficulty name. Most often "TAG" will be followed by a number, which typically denotes how many players the beatmap is meant for (e.g., "TAG2 for two players, TAG4 for four players, etc.).

Due to their nature, TAG difficulties are always unranked because they are intentionally designed to be near impossible for a single player, although this has not stopped users from trying.
