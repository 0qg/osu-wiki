# Jump

A **jump** is an [osu!](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!) gameplay element where two objects are spaced far apart on the playfield compared to the spacing between other objects. Jumps are usually played with snappy movement, as opposed to a smooth movement of [streams](/wiki/Beatmaps/Patterns/Stream).

Jumps usually signal high intensity in a song and are snapped to 1/2 ticks on the [hitobjects timeline](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timelines#hit-objects).
