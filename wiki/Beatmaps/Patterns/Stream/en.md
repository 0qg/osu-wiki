# Stream

A **stream** is an [osu!](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!) gameplay element where consecutive circles are grouped together and intended to be played by alternating clicking between fingers. Streams are usually played with smooth movement, as opposed to a snappy movement of [jumps](/wiki/Beatmaps/Patterns/Jump).

In most beatmaps, streams represent high note density in a song and are snapped to 1/4 ticks on the [hitobjects timeline](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor/Timelines#hit-objects).
