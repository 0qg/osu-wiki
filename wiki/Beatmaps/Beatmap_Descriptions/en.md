## About Beatmap Descriptions

Beatmap descriptions are small areas under a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps)'s page that give players information about said beatmap using [BBCode](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/BBCode). Most [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmaps#ranked) beatmaps use at least one image, a number (depending on how many beatmaps the creator has Ranked), and a difficulty section.

That is an example of a good beatmap description. Here's what you need to know about good Beatmap descriptions:

## Making Beatmap Descriptions

There are lots of ways to make Beatmap descriptions, but here we have 3.

You can upload the beatmaps, and when it's uploading, you can type the BBCode yourself.

### Second way

You can wait until the beatmap is uploaded, and then edit the description with the normal BBCode editor.

### Third way

You can go into an editor that supports BBCode, and type it yourself, and then upload the beatmap with that description.
