## About Beatmap Descriptions

Beatmap descriptions are small areas under a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps)'s page that give players information about said beatmap using [BBCode](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/BBCode). Most [Ranked](/wiki/Beatmaps#ranked) beatmaps use at least one image, a number (depending on how many beatmaps the creator has Ranked), and a difficulty section.


## Good Beatmap Descriptions

*Notice: In order to get a beatmap ranked, it is recommended you have a good beatmap description, but this is not required.

A good beatmap description would include:
- A list of all the guest difficulties and their creators
- An "18+ lyrics" warning (if neccessary)
- Information that would help a player decide whether they want to download the beatmap or not
- An edits list or changelog 

### Images

Many beatmap descriptions contain at least one image. To learn know how to add a image using BBCode, check out the [BBCode article](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/BBCode#image).

**Notes:**
- Most image usage in a beatmap description use an image as a banner.
- You can use [ShareX](https://getsharex.com) to upload the images to imgur, or other image websites.
- Using the [difficulty icons](#difficulty-icons) count as using an image.

### Difficulty Sections

A difficulty section in a beatmap description has who made the difficulty, and sometimes information about the difficulty.
Difficulty sections usually have images for the icons.

## Making Beatmap Descriptions

There are lots of ways to make Beatmap descriptions, but here we have 3.

### First way

You can upload the beatmaps, and when it's uploading, you can type the BBCode yourself.

### Second way

You can wait until the beatmap is uploaded, and then edit the description with the normal BBCode editor.

### Third way

You can go into an editor that supports BBCode, and type it yourself, and then upload the beatmap with that description.
