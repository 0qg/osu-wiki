# Beatmapsets

<!-- TODO: connect to the rest of the wiki, ultimately this should replace the Glossary entry and be clearly distinguished from "beatmaps" -->

A **beatmapset** is a set of [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps) for the same song managed by a [beatmapset host](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmapsets/Beatmapset_host). The [beatmap listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) shows all of the beatmapsets submitted online.

Beatmapsets are sometimes referred to as "beatmaps", but on this wiki "beatmap" usually means a single difficulty.
