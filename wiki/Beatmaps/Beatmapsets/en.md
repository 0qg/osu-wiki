# Beatmapsets

<!-- TODO: connect to the rest of the wiki, ultimately this should replace the Glossary entry and be clearly distinguished from "beatmaps" -->

A **beatmapset** is a set of [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps) for the same song. Beatmapsets can be [submitted](/wiki/Glossary#bss) by their creators to the website and show up on the [beatmap listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets). They are displayed on the website and in-game as authored by a single person, or [beatmapset host](Beatmapset_host), but in reality may be made by a group of people, or guests, that provide [guest difficulties](Guest_difficulty) or work in [collaboration](../Beatmap_collaborations) with the host or each other.

The relation between a beatmap and its beatmapset, as well as their uniqueness, is tracked via [Beatmap ID](../Beatmap_ID) and [Beatmapset_ID](../Beatmapset_ID) fields of the corresponding [`.osu` file](/wiki/osu!_File_Formats/Osu_(file_format)). It helps creators update beatmaps after [metadata changes](/wiki/Guides/Changing_the_Artist_or_Title), or when they start [using a different name](/wiki/Help_Centre#name-changes).

Beatmapsets are sometimes referred to as *beatmaps*, but on osu! wiki *beatmap* usually means a single difficulty.
