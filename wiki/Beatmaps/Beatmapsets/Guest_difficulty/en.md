# Guest difficulty

*For regulations surrounding guest difficulties, see: [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/)*

A **guest difficulty** or *GD* is a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) of a [beatmapset](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmapsets) that is not created by the [beatmapset host](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmapsets/Beatmapset_host). A beatmap featuring multiple mappers is also known as a [collaborative difficulty](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmap_collaborations). Guest difficulties usually use the creator's username in the difficulty's name.

There are many reasons for guest difficulties to exist:

- Etiquette in the community can make it difficult for multiple creators to upload beatmaps of the same song around the same time.
  - The guest creator, interested in creating a beatmap for a song, may choose to contribute a difficulty to an existing beatmapset instead.
- The guest creator may also decide upon playing a beatmap that they want to create a difficulty for it.
- The guest creator did not want to put in the effort in creating the difficulties on their own, but would rather just create one and give it to another creator.

On the other hand, it may be the creator who wants a few guest difficulties:

- To give the mapset a "community effort" feel.
- The creator did not want to create the difficulties themselves

Guest difficulties are often requested by private messages between creators but can also be requested in [modding queues](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/60).
