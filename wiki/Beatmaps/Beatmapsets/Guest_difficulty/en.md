# Guest difficulty

*For regulations surrounding guest difficulties, see: [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/)*

A **guest difficulty** (***GD***) is a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) of a [beatmapset](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmapsets) that is not created by the [beatmapset host](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmapsets/Beatmapset_host). They can usually be identified by their difficulty name containing the guest creator's username. A beatmap featuring multiple mappers is also known as a [collaborative difficulty](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmap_collaborations).

There are many reasons for guest difficulties to exist:

- Etiquette in the community can make it difficult for multiple creators to upload beatmaps of the same song around the same time.
  - The guest creator, interested in creating a beatmap for a song, may choose to contribute a difficulty to an existing beatmapset instead.
- The guest creator may also decide upon playing a beatmap that they want to create a difficulty for it.
- The guest creator did not want to put in the effort in creating the difficulties on their own, but would rather just create one and give it to another creator.

On the other hand, it may be the creator who wants a few guest difficulties:

- To give the mapset a "community effort" feel.
- The creator did not want to create the difficulties themselves

Some [modding queues](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/60)<!-- TODO: should link to an article about queues, not the forum --> take requests for creating guest difficulties.
