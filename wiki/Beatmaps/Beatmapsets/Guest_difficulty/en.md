# Guest difficulty

*For regulations surrounding guest difficulties, see: [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)*

A **guest difficulty** (***GD***) is a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) of a [beatmapset](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmapsets) that is not created by the [beatmapset host](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmapsets/Beatmapset_host). They can usually be identified by their difficulty name containing the guest creator's username. A beatmap featuring multiple mappers is also known as a [collaborative difficulty](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmap_collaborations).

Some [modding queues](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/60)<!-- TODO: should link to an article about queues, not the forum --> take requests for creating guest difficulties.
