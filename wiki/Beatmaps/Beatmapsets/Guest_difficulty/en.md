# Guest difficulty

A **guest difficulty** is a difficulty of a [beatmapset](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmapsets) that is not created by the [beatmapset host](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmapsets/Beatmapset_host). A guest difficulty featuring multiple mappers is also known as a [collaborative difficulty](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmap_collaborations)
