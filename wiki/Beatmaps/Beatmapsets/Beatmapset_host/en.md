# Beatmapset host

A **beatmapset host** is the creator and manager of a [beatmapset](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmapsets) who creates the majority of its difficulties and organizes [guest difficulties](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmapsets/Guest_difficulty). A beatmapset host is usually responsible for finding mods and contacting [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators) to push their beatmapset through the [beatmap ranking procedure](/wiki/Beatmap_ranking_procedure).
