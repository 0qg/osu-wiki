# Nightcore

*Not to be confused with [New Combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/New_Combo).*

![Nightcore (NC) mod icon](/wiki/shared/mods/NC.png "Nightcore (NC) mod icon")

**Nightcore** (*NC*) is a [game modifier](/wiki/Game_Modifiers) which increases the pitch and adds a drum track to the currently selected [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). In 4/4 time the drum track adds a bass drum on beats 1 and 3, claps on beats 2 and 4, and a crash on beat 1 every 4 measures.

Nightcore can only be used in conjunction with the Double Time mod which increases the beatmap's tempo by 150%. The [score](/wiki/Score) multiplier is unaffected beyond the effects of Double Time:

- osu!standard - 1.12x
- osu!taiko -  1.12x
- osu!catch - 1.06x
- osu!mania - 1.00x

Shortcut key: `DD` (from unselected) or `Shift`+`D`
