# How to use the offset wizard
*See also: [Universal Offset](/wiki/Universal_offset)*

If the [Hitsounds](/wiki/Beatmapping/Hitsound) feel out of sync with the music, in every beatmap you play, you will more than likely need to change your [universal offset](/wiki/Universal_offset). The easiest way to do this is by using the **offset wizard**.

Follow these steps to adjust your universal offset using the offset wizard:

**Opening the offset wizard**:

1. Open osu!.
2. Go to the `Options` menu, or press `Ctrl` + `O`.
3. Search "offset" in the quick-search and click on `Offset wizard`.

The offset wizard will then open, playing the song that was previously playing in osu!, while a green bar scrolls across the screen and a metronome plays.

**Using the offset wizard to calibrate your universal offset**:

1. Listen carefully to the song and the metronome playing together.
2. Start adjusting the universal offset up or down, using the `Up arrow` or `Down arrow` keys, or the `Scroll wheel`.
   - If, in-game, the hitsounds seem like they are playing too early, you will need to *decrease* your universal offset.
   - If, in-game, the hitsounds seem like they are playing too late, you will need to *increase* your universal offset.
3. Adjust it until you hear the metronome line up perfectly with the song, using the scrolling bar on the screen to help you.
4. Once you have successfully calibrated your universal offset, press the `Back` button in the bottom left to exit the offset wizard.

If the metronome feels too fast or too slow for the song, you may want to enable either `Half tick` or `Double tick` in the top left of the screen to make things easier.
