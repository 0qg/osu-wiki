# Videos from YouTube

[YouTube](https://youtube.com) is a very convenient resource. If the song has a music video, it will most likely be on YouTube, and probably compressed at that golden point where the video looks decent but won't be a pain to download.

This tutorial is intended for those who **can not** find the video elsewhere but YouTube.

## Using online tools

[ytmp3.cc](https://ytmp3.cc) is an online YouTube converter service. Using ytmp3.cc is very straightforward. Paste the YouTube video link into the text box, select "mp4", and click "Convert". After conversion is finished, click "Download" to download the video file.

## Using youtube-dl

[youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org) is a command-line program to download videos from YouTube and other sites. The fastest way to download from YouTube using youtube-dl is by using the ```-f bestvideo``` option. Example:```youtube-dl.exe -f bestvideo <video link>```

## Loading video into your beatmap

Open your beatmap in the editor and go to the "Design" tab, then click "Background Image/Video". Select your file to add it to your beatmap. Use the slider below to adjust the time offset.
