# Handling Cheating


## Why am I banned?
A user may get banned if they do any of the following:
-   Continuous misbehaviour regardless of how many infringements they accumulate.
-   Sharing their account with other users.
-   Using multiple accounts.
-   Hacking or cheating (see below).


## What is considered cheating?
The rules say that any form of manipulation of the client such as score hacking, macro-enabled full-combo sequences, auto-aim and anything else that plays the game for the player.

This is a one-strike rule. Cheaters will be banned on their first offence and for an indefinite amount of time. The team may decide to lift their ban if they successfully appeal.


## I have been banned for cheating. I didn't cheat!
osu! uses automated metrics combined with manual confirmation.

The team never places an incorrect ban for cheating. Before they take any action, they make sure it is 100% that you cheated.


## My friend has been banned for cheating! They definitely wouldn't cheat! You are wrong!
We understand that you trust your friends, but you will have to believe the team. Punishments aren't issued unless there is sufficient evidence to support the decision. Whether or not they have cheated, it shouldn't affect your friendship!


## Prove that I/they were cheating! Tell us how you know!
The team cannot say on how can they prove. Giving away the countermeasures would make them useless in further detecting cheaters.


## I'll make a video to prove my innocence!
Sorry but if you have been banned, they are already 100% sure you are cheating. A video will not help.


## I found someone who is definitely cheating. I can tell by their replay/score! What should I do?
Stay calm and **don't discuss their play in public chat**.
Don't give them undue attention or ask others to spectate them. There are three ways to report users.

### User Profile
On the user's profile, a `Report User` button will appear when you move your cursor to their avatar. Write any information that can prove that the user is doing misbehaviour.

*Take note of the selected game mode before reporting*

### Beatmap Page
In beatmap pages, you can report a user in the top leaderboards by clicking the `Report` button on the far right of their score.

### In-game chat
Use the `!report` command in any public channel to inform the chat moderators. Other players will not see your reports in chat.

      Format: !report <username> <reason>
     Example: !report this_user suspected cheating

Your help in spotting foul play is much appreciated. You can also send an email directly to [osu@ppy.sh](mailto:osu@ppy.sh) for a relatively fast response.


## Is using specialized hardware counted as cheating?
Peripherals such as tablets and touchscreens are fine. Anything which decreases the skill required to play or cancels/defeats the effect of the game modifiers are not. This means that using multiple PCs, input splitters or anything of that kind is considered a no-no.


## How can I request a ban appeal?
Wait for three months after the latest issued ban before appealing. Address your emails to [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) and use a subject of `Ban Appeal: <username>`

Users must give a full history of their wrongdoings and give reasons why they won't be reoffending in the future.

*It might take time for us to reply to your appeal, but no appeals are ignored.*


## What can I do if I've broken the rules?
If you've broken the rules and you'd like to come clean, please contact [accounts@ppy.sh](mailto:accounts@ppy.sh) and explain what you've done. Honesty is very much appreciated and this will likely not result in a permanent punishment.


## How can I avoid being silenced or banned?
Carefully read and follow the [rules](/wiki/Rules).
