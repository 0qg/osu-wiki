# Abandoned wasteland

The **abandoned wasteland** is a hidden [sub-forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums) where old and abandoned forums are laid to rest. This sub-forum is only accessible to moderators who have the power to modify the forums. The instructions to moderators concerning it is: "Put stuff we do not really need in here." When a forumthread is said to be "wastelanded", it means that is moved here.
