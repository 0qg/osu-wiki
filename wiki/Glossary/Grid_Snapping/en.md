# Grid Snapping

**Grid snapping** refers to a button on the right-hand side of the [beatmap editor](/wiki/Beatmap_Editor). Enabling it will force every [hit object](/wiki/Hit_object/) that is interacted with to snap along the intersections of the grid.

The base level of spacing between each sector of the grid can be adjusted by pressing `G` or by going to `View` then `Grid Level`. Grid snapping can help with aligning objects to each other and arranging them in patterns.
