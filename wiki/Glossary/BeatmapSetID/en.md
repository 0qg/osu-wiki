# Beatmapset ID

*See also: [BeatmapID](/wiki/Glossary/BeatmapID)*

A *beatmapsetID* is an ID shared between all difficulties of a [beatmapset](/wiki/Beatmaps/Beatmapsets). This number is a unique, whole number which can never be changed. This allows for permanent navigation to and from a beatmapset. The beatmapsetID can be found in the url of a beatmapset on osu! web as the first set of numbers, or in the `.osu` difficulty file.

All unsubmitted beatmaps will have a BeatmapsetID of `-1`.

You can use the beatmapsetID to find a beatmapset using this url: `osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/{BeatmapsetID}` or alternatively `osu.ppy.sh/s/{BeatmapsetID}`.
