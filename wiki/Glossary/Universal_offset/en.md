# Universal offset

*Note: In most cases, after being determined, the universal offset does not need to be modified again.*

**Universal offset** is the the audio offset that applies to all songs used in osu!. It can also be described as the time delay between the following:

- The object graphics and sample set sounds associated with them, and
- The point in a song where said sounds should be heard.

Each player's universal offset value differs from one another due to variations in different systems' specifications. Thus the hierarchy in determining how offset will be placed is universal offset over online offset over local offset. 

An incorrectly determined universal offset will cause significant timing problems for every single [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) that a player plays or edits.

The universal offset is located in the [Options](/wiki/Options) menu in-game.
