# Juice Stream

**Juice streams** are an element element in [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch/) which includes both Drops and Droplets. Drops give a score of 100, equivalent to slider ticks in [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!/), while Droplets give a score of 10, equivalent to the [slider tick](#slider-tick) in osu!standard.

Missing a Drop breaks the player's combo, but missing a Droplet does not.

The visual difference between Drops and Droplets is that a Drop is twice as big as Droplets are.
