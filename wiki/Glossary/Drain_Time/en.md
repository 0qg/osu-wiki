# Drain Time

*For regulations surrounding drain time, see the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria).*

The **drain time**, or *drain*, refers to the total duration of a beatmap that requires the player to be active. Drain time does not consider the breaks and unmapped parts throughout the beatmap. Maps with very long drain times are typically referred to as marathon maps and require endurance beyond the norm in order to complete successfully.
