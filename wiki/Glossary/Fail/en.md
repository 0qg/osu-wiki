# Fail

**Fail** has three different meanings:

- The incompletion of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) due to:
  - Not filling the health bar up to 80% when completing a beatmap in [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko).
  - Emptying the health bar in [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch), and [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania).
- In multiplayer there may be a fail indicator underneath a player's name to show they have failed the beatmap.
- The player having less than 50% [health](/wiki/Beatmapping/Health) during a break; where an indicator will display if you failed the section.
  - A fail indicator will be shown.
  - A failed [storyboard](/wiki/Storyboard_Scripting) animation will be played if available.
