# Full Combo

**Full combo** or *FC* is a term used to describe a player obtaining the maximum possible [combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo) on a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). To obtain a full combo, a player has to clear a beatmap without missing or sliderbreaking any [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object/).

Due to the combo multiplier effect, full combos will award the most score in the [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko), and [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch) game modes. See the below comparison for an example of the score difference between a full combo and a broken combo.
