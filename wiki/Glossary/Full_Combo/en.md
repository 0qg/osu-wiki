# Full combo

**Full combo** (*FC*) is a term used to describe a player obtaining the maximum possible [combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo) on a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). To obtain a full combo, a player has to clear a beatmap without missing or sliderbreaking any [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object).

Due to the combo multiplier effect, full combos will award the most [score](/wiki/Score) in the [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko), and [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch) [game modes](/wiki/Game_Modes). See the comparison below for an example of the score difference between a full combo and a broken combo.
