# Katu

A **katu(喝)**, or *Beat!*, is when you complete a [comboset](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo) without achieving the highest level of [accuracy](/wiki/Accuracy). If instead the comboset was done perfectly a Geki(激) would be achieved.

This idea originates from the Nintendo DS game Elite Beat Agents which is one of the games the [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!) [game mode](/wiki/Game_Modes) is based on.
