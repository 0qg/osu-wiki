# Combobreak

**Combobreak** is a term used to describe a player losing their [combo](/wiki/Glossary/Combo_Score_Multiplier) during any part of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). By default, they will play a "combobreak sound" if the player has broken a combo of 30x or higher. And if enabled in the settings, a combo burst image will appear at certain [milestones](/wiki/Glossary/Combo_Multiplier_Effect).

*Notice: there is no in-game option to disable combobreak sound effects. But players who do not want to hear combobreak sounds may replace the `combobreak.wav` file with a `.wav` audio file that is 0 seconds long and/or use an audio file editor to make the audio completely silent.*
