# Blanket

**Blanket**, is a term to describe when a [sliderbody](/wiki/Hit_object/Sliderbody) wraps around the shape of another [hit object](/wiki/Hit_Objects/). Blanketing can be done in many ways to fit the visual style of a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps/). A guide to making them can be found in the [mapping techniques article](/wiki/Mapping_Techniques/Making_Good_Sliders#beat-blankets).
