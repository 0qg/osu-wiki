# z/x

<!-- this article is *very* unnecessary, this should be deleted later on -->

**z/x** are the default keyboard keys used to tap in [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!).

During gameplay, while `Z` is pressed, the left mouse will not be inputted, and vice-versa. The same applies to the `X` key and the right mouse button, and vice-versa.
