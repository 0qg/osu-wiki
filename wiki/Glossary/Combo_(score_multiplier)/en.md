# Combo (score multiplier)

*Not to be confused with [Combo (comboset)](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo).*

**Combo** refers to the number of [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects) a player has hit consecutively without missing or [sliderbreaking](/wiki/Glossary#sliderbreak) once. This number is displayed in various places during gameplay:

- Bottom-left in [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!).
- On the drums in [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko).
- Above the fruit catcher in [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch).
- Centre of the stage in [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania) (vertical height varies by skin).

*Max combo* is the player's highest achieved combo throughout the play.
