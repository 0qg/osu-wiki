# Loved

**Loved** is a state given to [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps/) that don't follow the [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria), but are considered popular enough to deserve their own leaderboards. Loved beatmaps contribute to a user's total playcount, but does not contribute to their [performance points](/wiki/Performance_Points). All scores on a Loved beatmap will be deleted if it moves out of the Loved category (this usually only happens on the creator's request).

Loved beatmaps use the heart icon ![](/wiki/shared/status/loved.png) in the song selection screen, and are regularly added through [Project Loved](/wiki/Project_Loved/) which is handled by the [Project Loved Team](/wiki/People/The_Team/Project_Loved_Team/en.md).
