# Health bar

*For Health as a mechanic, see: [Health](/wiki/Beatmapping/Health/en.md)*

The **health bar** (also known as the *HP bar*) is a bar which displays a player's remaining [health](/wiki/Beatmapping/Health/en.md). In all [game modes](/wiki/Game_Modes/) expect for [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania), there is an indicator moving along it, showing a player's current health. If the bar drains completely the player fails the current [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps/) (assuming no special game modifiers are enabled).

In [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch), and [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko) the health bar is displayed in the top-left corner of the screen. In osu!mania it is rotated 90 degrees,counterclockwise and is placed to the right of the playfield.

In osu!standard and osu!catch, the healthbar will drain at a constant rate throughout the course of a beatmap, with the exception of breaks. This effect is known as [health drain](/wiki/Beatmapping/Health_drain/).
