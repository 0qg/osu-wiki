# Nintendo DS Games

The **Nintendo DS Games** (or *DS Games* for short) were a set of original rhythm games developed by [iNiS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INiS) for the [Nintendo DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS) in the early 2000s. The gameplay of these games inspired the creation of the [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!) [game mode](/wiki/Game_Modes). The DS games' level design also influenced the early years of osu!standard mapping heavily.

The games referred to are:

- [Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osu!_Tatakae!_Ouendan)
- [Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan! 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moero!_Nekketsu_Rhythm_Damashii_Osu!_Tatakae!_Ouendan_2)
- [Elite Beat Agents](/wiki/Glossary/Elite_Beat_Agents)
