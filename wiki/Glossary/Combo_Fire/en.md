# Combo Fire

![Ancient screenshot of the combo fire](/wiki/shared/combo-fire.jpg "R.I.P. combo fire")

*Combo fire* was a background gameplay element originally integrated into osu! from the DS games. This would display a burning, yellow flame after obtaining a [combo milestone](/wiki/Glossary/Combo_Milestone). If the player obtained a [combo](/wiki/Glossary/Combo_Score_Multiplier) of 500, the combo fire would change colour from yellow to blue. The fire would extinguish if the combo was broken but would be reobtainable if combo was regained.

Combo fire was disabled 5th of March, 2013 due to performance concerns.
