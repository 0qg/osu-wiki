# Comboburst

*Combobursts* celebrate achieving a [combo milestone](/wiki/Glossary/Combo_Milestone).

- For [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!) and [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch), a character will *burst* out from either the left or right side of the window.
- For [osu!taiko](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!taiko), a collection of flowers will *burst* behind pippidon.
- For [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania), a character will *burst* from the right side of the stage (or left side or both if specified in the `skin.ini`).

In addition to this, for osu!standard, osu!taiko, and osu!catch, stars will shoot out from either the left or right side of the playfield, for combos less than 100, then both sides for combos 100 or higher. For osu!mania, the stars will shoot out from the left and right sides of the stage.

Combobursts can be disabled in the options.
