# Changelog

The [changelog](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog) is a page where peppy and the osu!dev team detail their day-by-day improvements, additions, and bug fixes to the game. All changes from prior releases are recorded here for future browsers to view.

*Note: the changelog was originally a series of forum posts in 2007 before becoming the official page it is today.*
