# Geki

**Geki (æ¿€)**, or *Elite Beat!*, is a [scoring](/wiki/Score) term used when a player has completed a comboset with the highest possible [accuracy](/wiki/Gameplay/Accuracy) on every note. This idea originates from the Nintendo DS game Elite Beat Agents which the [osu!standard](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!) [game mode](/wiki/Game_Modes) is based on.
