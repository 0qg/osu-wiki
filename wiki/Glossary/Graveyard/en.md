# Graveyard

The **graveyard** is a subforum for [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps/) that have been abandoned. Graveyarded maps do not count towards a user's total upload limit. The owner may revive them by updating the beatmap, which sends it back to being a Work in Progress. This requires having a free pending slot.

Beatmaps that are not updated or receive no posts from their owner for 28 days will be automatically sent to the Graveyard.
