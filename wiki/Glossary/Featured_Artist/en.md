# Featured Artist

*Main page: [Featured Artists](/wiki/Featured_Artists)*

A featured artist is an artist who has officially licensed their music for use in osu!. Their music has been cleared by the [osu! team](/wiki/People/The_Team/) and their songs are suitable for [beatmapping](/wiki/Beatmapping/). All tracks from featured artists include a pre-timed `.osz` file to help you focus on beatmapping.
