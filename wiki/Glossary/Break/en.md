# Break

**Breaks** are sections of a [beatmap](/wiki/beatmaps) which have no [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_Objects). During this time, the drain of the health bar is temporarily halted. Breaks usually allow the player to rest their arm for a short while and reposition their input device. The use of breaks in [osu!mania](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!mania) beatmaps is heavily discouraged.

Depending on the enabled settings, letterboxes may appear when a break is initiated. In addition to this, a passing or failing graphic and sound may appear to indicate if a player is doing well or not. This will only appear if there is enough time for the graphic to show.
