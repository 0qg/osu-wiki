# Grade

**Grades** are letter-grades representing a player's performance on a given [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps/). It accompanies the total [score](/wiki/Score) at the result screen and appears in all lists where scores appear.

From lowest to highest, the possible grades are F, C, B, A, S, Silver S, SS, and Silver SS. Silver grades are only achievable with the hidden difficulty modifier.
