# Aspire

**Aspire** is a [beatmapping](/wiki/Beatmapping) [contest](/wiki/Contests) where the mappers are encouraged to fully ignore the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) and explore gameplay-mechanics that aren't typically used in beatmapping. The resulting beatmaps tend to be nearly impossible to play for average players.
