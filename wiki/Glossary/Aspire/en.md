# Aspire

*Aspire* is a [beatmapping](/wiki/Beatmapping) [contest](/wiki/Contests) where the creators are encouraged to fully ignore the [Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) and explore gameplay-mechanics that aren't typically used. The resulting beatmaps tend to be cosmetically appealing displays of absolute madness, but are often nearly impossible to play for average players.
