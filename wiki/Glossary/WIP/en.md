# WIP

<!-- i personally don't think this stub is necessary -->

**WIP** (or **W.I.P**) is an abbreviation for "work in progress." Although not specific to osu!, "WIP" is often used as shorthand for the [Work in progress](/wiki/Beatmaps#work-in-progress) category.

And there are various reasons why one would want to mark a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) as WIP:

- the beatmap is deemed incomplete by its creator
  - one of the difficulty versions is incomplete
- the beatmap is pending correction
- there are current suggestions on timing
- the beatmap needs feedback

WIP can be submitted through the BSS to the [Works in Progress/Help forum](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/10).
