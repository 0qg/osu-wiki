# Touhosu!

*For the Touhosu! feature request, see: [Touhosu! / Dodge the Beat](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/19307)*

**Touhosu!** is a feature request from 2011 that proposed a new game mode that combines elements of [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch) and the [Touhou Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project "Wikipedia") (a bullet hell shoot 'em up video game series). The mode was inspired by the aforementioned Touhou Project, as well as a previous feature request called "Dodge the Beat," that aimed to create a game mode in which players dodge fruits, as opposed to catching them like in osu!catch.

The feature request garnered significant attention from users, with over 522 total replies. However, as for now, there are reportedly no plans of adding Touhosu! or Dodge the Beat into osu!.
