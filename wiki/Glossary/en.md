# Glossary

Throughout the years, the osu! community has adopted its own set of slang that may be confusing for newcomers.
This page is a compilation of such terms for reference.
Additions and edits are always welcome.

<!--Links with a prefixed "#" symbol are also terms of this glossary, while blue links link to other articles.-->

## A

### Abandoned Wasteland

If the name isn't obvious enough, the abandoned wasteland is a hidden sub-forum where the instructions to the moderators concerning it will: "Put stuff we don't really need in here."
When a thread is "wastelanded", it is moved there.

### AFK

AFK is an internet acronym that means "Away From Keyboard".
An example if this is when an active user walks off to do something else while they're still logged on.
osu! will mark users as "Idle" if they have been inactive for sometime.

### Approach Circle

In [osu!standard](/wiki/Game-Modes/osu!/en.md), the approach circle is the outermost circle that will enclose the hitcircle, the start of a Slider, or the center of the spinner.
When the approach circle touches the outer border of the hitcircle or slider you should click.
For the spinners, the approach circle will indicate the duration of the spinner.

### Authentic

Authentic is a word that denotes a beatmap that emulates in every aspect of a specific stage from the DS games (song, settings, object placement, etc.).

## B

### Ban

A ban is an action taken against a player if caught violating a rule (i.e. multi-accounts or cheating).
However, there is a step-by-step process that users follow before getting banned, in most cases.

To see the number of bans given each month, see [Ban history](http://osu.ppy.sh/p/bans).

### Bancho

Bancho is the easily expandable server coded by peppy.
This replaces the need for a third-party IRC server in the management of all online content in osu!
Players automatically connect to Bancho when they start osu!, that is, if the player is connected to the internet.

### BAT

BAT&mdash;which was short for the "Beatmap Appreciation Team"&mdash;was a group of users that would rank and approve your beatmaps.
This team was renamed to "Beatmap Nominator".

### Beat

Beat is a term that applies to the timeline in Editor mode.
Beat is a period of time that songs can be divided into based off of their BPM.
A correctly timed Beatmap will have each beat correspond to the song's rhythm and a whole beat should fall between two white lines on the timeline.
Depending on the position of your snap divisor, other lines dividing a beat may be visible:

-    red lines for half beats,
-    blue lines for quarter beats,
-    yellow lines for eighth beats, and
-    purple lines for third and sixth beats

### Beatmap Pack

Beatmap packs _(if the name isn't clear)_ are packaged beatmaps.
Beatmap packs are collections ranked or approved beatmaps that can be downloaded from a file sharing service (Either on [osu!Mirror](osu.yas-online.net) or [MediaFire](www.mediafire.com)).

Most beatmap packs are sets of beatmaps that were ranked during the same time period. However, in some packs may contain songs of a similar style or theme.

Downloading beatmap packs is the recommended way of downloading beatmaps because this method of downloading beatmaps would save peppy bandwidth.

To see the beatmap packs, see [Beatmap Pack Listing](http://osu.ppy.sh/p/packlist)

### Beat Spacing

Beat spacing is a principle which states that the spacing of every object (except for spinners) should be either closer, if closely placed on the timeline, or farther, if placed farther apart on the timeline.
This basically means, "close in time = close in space" and "farther in time = farther in space".

Your beat spacing plays an crucial role when the player is playing your beatmap!
Consistent beat spacing is a basic requirement to rank a beatmap.
This provides the player with a more intuitive experience as the player will learn where to move their cursor along the screen,  at a constant speed.

Placing an object closer than the beat spacing may trick the player into clicking on them too soon.
On the otherhand, placing them too far may force the player to move their cursor across the screen to click on them in time.
A common exception to beat spacing is stacked hitcircles.

To ensure consistent beat spacing, turn on the "Distance Snap" button on the right-hand side of the editor.
You can choose a beat spacing value by holding [Alt] and sliding the selector at the top right until you reach the desired value.
Note that the higher the value would allow a more difficult beatmap.

### Beatmap

A beatmap (or "level" or "map") is where the majority of osu! lies.
It is quite like the stages in the DS games.
At their most basic form, beatmaps have a song, hitcircles, sliders, and/or spinners placed based on the rhythm of the music.
Nowadays, beatmaps may also have a background image or video, or even a storyboard.

For more details about how beatmaps are uploaded, see [#BSS](#BSS).

### Beatmapper

A beatmapper (or "Mapper") refers to the osu!user who uses the editor to create a beatmap.

### Beatmapset

A beatmapset (or "mapset") is the collection of beatmaps that are packaged inside the `OSZ` file, under the same beatmapper.
Beatmapsets will always have the same music/sound, video, if any.
However, do note that some beatmaps from a beatmapset may specifically contain a certain background image or storyboard that is separate from the others.

### BG

BG is short for "background" and refers to the background image and/or video of a beatmap.
Inside a beatmap folder, "BG" is usually the name for the background image.

### BPM

BPM is short for "Beats Per Minute" and represents the number of whole beats in a minute.

### Break

A break is when a section of a beatmap has no objects.
During this time, the drain in the life bar is temporarily halted.
Breaks usually allow the player to rest their arm for a short while and reposition their input device.

Depending on the settings, when a break is initated, letterboxes (the black horizontal bars on the top and bottom off the screen) may appear.
In addition to this, a "passing" or "failing" graphic and sound will appear and play to indicate if the player is doing well or not, if there is enough time.

### BSS

BSS is short for "Beatmap Submission System".

When a beatmapper is finished mapping their beatmap and is ready to share their creation around the world, they must first submit it to the BSS.
When they do this, the BSS will automatically assign a fourm thread and will generate a post with information about your beatmapset.
The fourm thread it generates will help you get feedback from modders and other osu!users who play your map.


## C

### Changelog

The changelog is a forum thread where peppy and the osu!dev team details their day-by-day improvements, additions and bug fixes.

To see the changelog, see [Recent Releases](http://osu.ppy.sh/p/changelog).

### Choke

A choke occurs when the player almosts obtains a full combo for beatmap, but loses it near the end.

On the contrary, a reverse choke is when the player loses their combo at the beginning but obtains a full combo for the rest of the beatmap.

### Clap

Clap is a hitsound that is part of a sample set.
The use of claps is usually reserved for emphasizing and punctuating points in a song more in a different way than the whistle and finish.

Its default form and icon in the editor is that of two hands clapping.


### Collab

Collab (or "collaboration") has two meanings:

1.   the work of multiple mappers mapping a single beatmap; usually a marathon beatmap.
     -    When collaborating on a #Beatmap, the creator must #Map a majority (at least half) of the #Beatmap, this is to ensure that the creator has done enough to upload the map under their username.
2.   the mapset containing guest difficulties

The term "Collab" may sometimes be seen in difficulty names.

### Combo

Combo has two meanings:

1.   A set of hitcircles and sliders that comes one after another. They have the same colour and correspond to a specific part of a beatmap's song. The last object in each combo, if hit, provides the player with a small boost to their life bar, if the player also achieves a Katu (or Beat!) or an Geki (or Elite Beat!). Every Spinner is a combo by itself (except for [osu!catch](/wiki/Game-Modes/osu!catch/en.md)). Combos should be kept under approximately 20 objects, and even lower than that the lower the difficulty is supposed to be.
2.   The number of objects a player has hit consecutively without missing or sliderbreaking once. The number is displayed at the bottom left of the playing field. Each #Hit Circle, beginning and end of a Slider, #Slider Tick and #Spinner that the player hits without #Missing in between causes the combo to increase by one. When the combo passes certain numbers, #Combobursts appear and stars flash across the screen. A single miss causes the Combo to reset and Combo Fire to vanish. Combo provides a bonus multiplier to the score of everything the player hits except Slider Ticks, which are always worth 10 points each, and every level filled in the Spinner Metre or Spinner bonus points, which is always worth 100 points and 1000 points each. Managing to finish a #Beatmap without missing once is called a #Full Combo. This is sometimes denoted by the phrase "Perfect!" on the results screen and will give an S #Grade or higher (unless the accuracy is lower).

### Skinner

A skinner refers to the osu!user who releases downloadable skins on the osu!forums. They may have had used an photo editing application such as GIMP or Photoshop.

### Storyboarder

A storyboarder refers to the osu!user who releases storyboards someone else's beatmap. They may have used the editor's design section to storyboard, used a third party application, or have done Storyboard Scripting (or SBS).
