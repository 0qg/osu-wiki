Introduction
------------

osu! Volunteer Helpers are users that have special privileges on certain sections of osu!. These users aren't considered osu! Staff but their efforts are considered for future reference if they want to aim for Staff. Volunteers have their position as their title on the forum and can be [osu! Alumni](osu!_Alumni "wikilink") if they decide to retire of their position.<sup>\[citation\\ needed\]</sup>

How to become one
-----------------

There is no formal way to be a Volunteer Helper other than helping users in a area they can help.
