### Google(TM) Custom Search

Typing in a search query will help find threads, beatmaps, and/or wiki pages inside osu!

### User

Begin typing in the "User" textbox and it will give you matching usernames. It is important to note that usernames can be changed and can affect your user search!

### Beatmap

Typing in a song title, username(s), name(s), song artist(s), song source(s), etc. will give you matching

Beatmap searches will not account words that are two letters or shorter, this is due to the limitation of the current search engine.

-   If you want to find a specific artist with a short name, try using the Google Search bar at the upper left-hand corner and typing the artist's name in enclosed quotation marks - such as "Xi", for instance.
