### Weekly multiplayer lobbies

As of now, joining the weekly multiplayer lobbies requires participants to download and install [osu!lazer](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases).

1. Every Friday of a season, a single timeshift multiplayer lobby is opened. Everyone can participate for 3 days.
   - In the final 2 weeks of a season, a timeshift multiplayer lobby for each of the 2 playlists will be opened.
2. Each timeshift multiplayer lobby provides a pre-defined playlist of beatmaps.
   - Each playlist is a subset of the whole roster of curated beatmaps for the current season.
   - Each playlist contains an even distribution of Hard, Insane and Expert beatmaps.
   - Each playlist corresponds with the letter assigned to each week. Therefore, each playlist gets replayed 3 times during a season.
3. Within a timeshift lobby, everyone competes towards a room-specific leaderboard.
   - Room leaderboards are based on the Ranked Score system. Therefore, only the best score results on each beatmap within the playlist are summed up to create a weekly Ranked Score for each user.
   - Each beatmap of a playlist counts equally to the leaderboard score. Harder difficulties do not provide more score.
   - Individual beatmap score is based on osu!lazer's scoring system.
4. The weekly total Ranked Score visible in the timeshift lobby is called "Weekly Ranked Score" onwards.
5. Once a timeshift lobby concludes, the Weekly Ranked Score of each participant of the room is added to the Seasonal Leaderboard.
