## Weekly multiplayer lobbies

As of now, joining the weekly multiplayer lobbies requires participants to download and install [osu!lazer](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases).

1. Every Friday of a season, a single timeshift multiplayer lobby is opened. Everyone can participate for the entire week.
   - There will be a week long intermission after which lobbies for each playlists will be opened again on a weekly basis.
2. Each timeshift multiplayer lobby provides a pre-defined playlist of beatmaps.
   - Each playlist is a subset of the whole roster of curated beatmaps for the current season.
   - Each playlist contains an even distribution of Hard, Insane and Expert beatmaps.
   - Each playlist corresponds with the letter assigned to each week. Therefore, each playlist gets replayed once during a season.
3. Within a timeshift lobby, everyone competes towards a room-specific leaderboard.
   - Room leaderboards are based on the ranked score system. Therefore, only the best score results on each beatmap within the playlist are summed up to create a weekly ranked score for each user.
   - Each beatmap of a playlist counts equally to the leaderboard score. Harder difficulties do not provide more score.
   - Individual beatmap score is based on osu!lazer's scoring system.
4. Once a timeshift lobby concludes, the weekly ranked score of each participant of the room is added to the seasonal leaderboard.
