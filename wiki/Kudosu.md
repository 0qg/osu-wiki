<img src="Kudosu_Durp.png" title="fig:A kudosu." alt="A kudosu." width="200" /> **Kudosu** is the form of reward obtained from [modding](modding "wikilink") beatmaps. The term "Kudosu" is named after a combination of the words "kudos" and "osu!". A rating system that rewards users that mod regularly. If you're a BN, or the creator of the map, you can award **1 or 2 kudosu** to a user depending on the time since last post on the beatmap thread, making a constructive modding post. Accumulated kudosu can be used to increase a beatmap's priority rating. Any [mapper](mapper "wikilink") or [modder](modder "wikilink") may spend 1 kudosu to give any [map](beatmap "wikilink") a star, which will help the map in the approval process by giving it more [Star Priority](Star_Priority "wikilink").

Before awarding kudosu keep the following things in mind:

-   Did the post help you in any way **to improve your map?**
-   Did the modder post things **that [AIMod](AIMod "wikilink") cannot pick up?**
-   Did the post show that the modder has **knowledge of modding?**
-   Did the modder post things that generally **make sense to you and seem not too terribly picky?** If their post did seem picky, are you sure that the things pointed out **can improve your mapset anyways?**
-   Even if you **don't** follow the modder's advice, did you not follow it because of **your personal choice only**, and not because **the modding seemed pointless to you?**
-   Did you not already give the modder kudosu for a mod post on the same map **recently**, and if you did, has the map **vitally changed** between the two mod posts (adding a difficulty, remapping a difficulty)?
-   Was this a **substantial mod post?** Did the mod post point out more than a couple of things to improve or fix your map?

<img src="Givekudosu.jpg" title="fig:Button to give Kudosu" alt="Button to give Kudosu" width="200" />If you can answer yes to all of these questions, **feel free to give the modder their well-earned kudosu!**

All a mapper has to do to give a modder kudosu is simply go to the mod post and click the "Give Kudos" button that is located under the poster's information.

Please be aware that beatmap nominators may revoke your kudosu if they deem that your post should not have been awarded kudosu!
