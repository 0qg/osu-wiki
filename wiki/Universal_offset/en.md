# Universal Offset

*For other uses, see [Offset (disambiguation)](/wiki/Disambiguation/Offset).*

**Universal Offset** is the audio offset [option](/wiki/Options) that applies to all [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap) in the osu! client. Setting it to a value other than `0` adds a delay between every beatmap's song and the other associated sounds and graphics. Setting the Universal Offset to a positive value will make the sounds and graphics associated with the beatmap appear earlier, while setting it to a negative value will make them appear later.

Each player's optimal universal offset value differs due to variations in their systems. A Universal Offset, other than `0`, should only be used when **all beatmaps** have a noticeable delay. Otherwise, a [local offset](/wiki/Glossary/Local_song_offset) should be used instead. An incorrectly determined Universal Offset will cause significant timing problems on all beatmaps.

For step-by-step instructions on how to set the Universal Offset to the correct value, see [How to use the Offset Wizard](/wiki/Guides/How_to_Use_the_Offset_Wizard)
