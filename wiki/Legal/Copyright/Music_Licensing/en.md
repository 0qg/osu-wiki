# Music Licensing

The osu! team reaches out to artists that the community loves and new artists whose music is appropriate for beatmapping in order to form licensing agreements. Those who agree to osu!'s licensing terms are a part of the [Featured Artists](/wiki/Featured_Artists) program.

Artists interested in joining the Featured Artist program are encouraged to contact osu! for licensing negotiations.

## Terms

Music licensed by osu! is freely available for download from the [Featured Artists listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) in `.osz` files, which are beatmap templates prepared with timing data. A one minute automatically generated preview of each track is available for streaming on its artist listing. Because songs are used as a catalog for community members to create beatmaps, there is no guarantee that they will be used in the game.

Additionally, Featured Artist songs are used as background music during [osu! World Cup](wiki/Tournaments#-osu!-world-cup) live streams.

osu!'s master use and synchronization license is non-exclusive, allowing simultaneous licensing with other platforms. The license is also in perpetuity, allowing for indefinite use within osu!. Payment is provided to musicians as a fixed once-off royalty.
