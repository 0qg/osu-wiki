# Music Licensing

Artists who enter a licensing agreement with osu! are listed under the [Featured Artists](/wiki/Featured_Artists) program. The osu! team regularly reaches out to artists that the community loves and new artists whose music is appropriate for use within the community and game.

Artists interested in joining the Featured Artist program are encouraged to contact osu! for licensing negotiations.

## Terms

Music licensed by osu! is freely available for download from the [Featured Artists listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) in `.osz` files, which are level (beatmap) templates. A one minute automatically generated preview of each track is available for streaming on its artist listing. Because songs are used as a catalog for community members to create beatmaps, there is no guarantee that they will be used in the game.

We look to cover usage within the game and related website, which does not include further usage on other streaming platforms (e.g. user uploads to YouTube). One exception is that we utilise Featured Artist tracks as background music during official events, such as [osu! World Cup](/wiki/Tournaments#-osu!-world-cup) live-streams. An exclusion clause can be negoatiated on request to completely restrict usage to within the game only.

osu! licences all music under non-exclusive terms, allowing simultaneous licensing with other platforms (it is our belief that we should not be limiting good music to only our platform). We generally prefer to negotiate licences on perpetual terms due to the nature of usage (users expect their creations to stay available indefinitely). Payment is provided as a fixed negotiable once-off royalty.
