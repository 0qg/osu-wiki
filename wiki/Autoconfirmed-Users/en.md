An <b>Autoconfirmed user</b> can do the following things compared to Anonymous (No account, IP address, aka random passer-by).

-   Create page,
-   Move a page,
-   Submit and make changes to unprotected pages,
-   Personal wiki-modification of how the wiki will look like (if you hated default UI) and a personal signature,
-   Your edit record.

In this wiki, all signed-in users are autoconfirmed users.
