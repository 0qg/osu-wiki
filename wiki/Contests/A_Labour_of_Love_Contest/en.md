    - Storyboard or custom video
- **Submission must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Beatmap must be in *osu!* game mode only.** Comparing beatmaps of different modes in a judging scenario is unfortunately not realistic.

- **Team name and members must be confirmed through [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjtVsUWIArvf--pKA0RLiCdXuO1_wO2Va2ICjenEcz9ZqI5Q/viewform).** If your country does not support Google forms, [send pishifat a message](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/chat?sendto=3178418). Teams are limited to 5 members.

Teams are encouraged tease their submissions in this contest prior to the results being announced.
