-------------

He's skillfully adept in achieving HDHR scores on maps that many other players have trouble with just getting NoMod Full Combos on, such as the Freedom difficulty of [FujuniseikouyuuP - FREEDMAN](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/283705&m=0), [Yooh - snow storm -euphoria-](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/386760&m=0) (on which he achieved the first HDHR Full Combo,) [Studio EIM - Crescent Moon Island Boss Theme](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/434438&m=0) (on which to date he has the only HDHR Full Combo on,) and quite a few more. He used many different playstyles, such as Tap+X and Dual Mouse (also called Tobe Mouse.) Overall, he's very well-rounded and accurate.
![](de.gif "fig:de.gif") ****, also known as loliXn, is a German osu! standard player who was once the highest ranked mouse player achieving rank \#9 in terms of performance points. He emerged on August 2014 as one of the greatest streamers in osu! His exceptional performance on the map [xi - FREEDOM DiVE \[FOUR DIMENSIONS\]](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/129891?m=0) gave him a lot of recognition and respect. Another score that shows his amazing streaming ability is the map [A\*Teens - Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!](http://osu.ppy.sh/s/46218) with the mods Hidden and Doubletime.
![](Gb.gif "fig:Gb.gif") **** has been a long time member of osu! who has normally held a high rank. At one point, back in 2010 when the score based ranking system was still around, Doomsday was even at [\#1 overall.](http://puu.sh/azgbO/8026b6f5eb) Even in an age where tablet players lead the scoreboards, Doomsday made a name for himself as a mouse user.
![](Nl.gif "fig:Nl.gif") **** is considered a top player in the osu! community. However, despite his amazing plays, HappyStick is widely known for his [Twitch Livestream](http://www.twitch.tv/happystick), in which he has attracted many new players to the osu! community. Others may know HappyStick from his [Jomekka - Eighto](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/135370&m=0) play, achieving an S rank on the incredibly difficult map with **99,5%** accuracy.
![](Tw.gif "fig:Tw.gif") ****, also known as SnowWhite, is another really old player up there with people like [WubWoofWolf](http://osu.ppy.sh/u/39828). For a while, he was often battling with [sayonara-bye](http://osu.ppy.sh/u/713266) for the \#1 spot. He is known by many for his impressive score on [Sagara Kokoro - Hoshizora no Ima](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/221950?m=0) with the mods Hidden and Double Time, as well as his outstanding score on the map [Saiya - Remote Control](http://osu.ppy.sh/s/53857). He was the first player to ever achieve two top ranks worth over 500pp and was also the first person to reach 10,000pp in osu! standard mode. This feat is not only incredible as a historic milestone in osu! history, but also for the fact that at the time of achieving 10,000pp he was about 600 pp ahead of the \#2 player, . He was also the first player to have 10 individual scores all worth over 500pp, and currently holds the highest ever osu!standard PP score, which is an unbelievable play on [HoneyWorks - Miraizu feat.Aida Miou(CV:Toyosaki Aki)](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/696225&m=0), worth **665pp.**
![](Ru.gif "fig:Ru.gif") **** is a Russian osu! standard player who has recently become one of the best players in the world, achieving rank \#2 globally.

He is one of, if not the best at consistency, due to his incredibly low unstable rate and skill at spaced streams. One of his most famous scores is his 98.14% accuracy full combo on [DragonForce - The Last Journey Home](http://osu.ppy.sh/s/172072), which is the first score to be rated over 600pp.

(TV Size)](http://osu.ppy.sh/b/148083). Kynan has become a staple amongst the fastest in osu!.
![](Us.gif "fig:Us.gif") **** was the original flashlight god achieving outstanding replays with Flashlight, and sometimes even hidden and still achieving over 99% accuracy.

![](Pl.gif "fig:Pl.gif") **** has struck awe into other players with his DT/HD+DT speed and stamina abilities and also surprises everyone with his HR/HD+HR plays, which are quite stable, examples of the two being his [L.E.D.-G - SOUND OF GIALLARHORN](http://osu.ppy.sh/p/beatmap?b=397503) HD+HR score, which has an impressive Unstable Rate of 83.48, and his [HoneyWorks - Miraizu feat.Aida Miou(CV:Toyosaki Aki)](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/696225&m=0) score which is worth **596pp**.

![](Us.gif "fig:Us.gif") **** for many years uploaded beatmap packs for all ranked and approved maps. He also created special beatmap packs for Ranking Charts, certain themes or just packs for a particular artist.
![](Pl.gif "fig:Pl.gif") ****, more well known as Hatsuney, is the sole developer of the [Mikuia Bot](http://mikuia.tv/) used by most osu! twitch streamers. The Mikuia Bot allows users in twitch chat to request songs to the streamer and have them notified in-game, the bot also displays the amount of pp gained/lost after finishing a song. [The code can be found at Github](https://github.com/Maxorq/Mikuia)
![](Us.gif "fig:Us.gif") **** was responsible for creating the [BAT](BAT "wikilink") and was the first BAT manager. Some *older* players may know him for [the notorious James Training pack](http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/4280/).
![](Us.gif "fig:Us.gif") **** was the manager and founder of the original osu!Monthly which attracted and entertained a large portion of the community.
![](De.gif "fig:De.gif") **** is the sole developer of [Tillerino Bot](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/219444) that is widely used among the community as a useful tool which recommends maps around a player's skill level (based from their top ranks) to gain [Performance Points](Performance_Points "wikilink").

![](Us.gif "fig:Us.gif") **** is the founder and chief contributor to the osu!academy, and also one of the scarce few members to attain more than 100 ranked maps. He was also one of the staff members responsible for managing the MAT during its early phases. His experimentation with various storyboarding styles prompted several other mappers to adopt the format in their beatmaps, and is thus considered one of the earliest storyboarders.
