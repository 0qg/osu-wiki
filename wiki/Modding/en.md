# Modding

Modding is the act of providing feedback on another user's [beatmap](/wiki/beatmap). A user who is modding is referred to as a `modder` and their collective posts on a beatmap's discussion are referred to as a `mod`.

Mods are mainly used to improve beatmaps aiming for Ranked status. Because it is a detailed and analytical process, modding beatmaps is also a popular way for users improve their understanding of beatmapping.

## Finding beatmaps to mod

[Modding Queues](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/60) are the most actively utilized platform for finding beatmaps to mod and requesting mods. A user can create their own forum thread, referred to as a `queue`, for other users to post beatmaps that they want to be modded. 

Each queue's creator dictates the queue's rules, controlling which beatmaps are viable for receiving mods. Queues are usually open for requests in two ways:
 - **Normal mod (NM):** A mod that will be provided without work from the requesting beatmapper.
- **Mod for mod (M4M):** A trade that requires each user to mod the other's beatmap.

The `#modreqs` chat channel is populated by beatmappers posting maps they want modded. Most beatmaps posted do not receive mods.

Well known modders often note whether or not they are accepting mod requests on their user profiles.

Searching the pending beatmaps listing for beatmaps to mod is not recommended because most submissions are not aiming for Ranked status, so their creators will potentially not respond to mods.

## Modding process

To mod a beatmapset, start by downloading the most up to date version and opening its discussion page. Play the difficulty you want to mod and keep in mind any gameplay-related issues. When completed, open the difficulty in the editor and analyze it for potential issues. 

When you come across an issue, select any relevant hit objects, then use the copy shortcut (`Ctrl`+`C`) to copy their timestamp information. On the beatmap's discussion page, locate the difficulty being modded and navigate to the applicable tab. The `Timeline` tab is used for issues regarding specific parts of a beatmap, the `General (This difficulty)` tab is used for feedback on larger sections of a beatmap, and the `General (All difficulties)` tab is used for issues applicable to all difficulties on a beatmapset.

All mod posts should address what the issue is, why it is an issue, and how to fix it. For example, if a beatmap has an unnecessarily large jump, a mod could potentially be worded as "The spacing between these objects is too high. The song is not intense enough to justify this size of a jump, so moving the objects closer together would be more appropriate!". Many mod posts include links to images so that beatmappers can better understand any suggestions.

Modders should not assume a beatmapper understands why anything is an issue within their beatmap. When simplifying a mod post into a command like "Add a New Combo on this object", the beatmapper may not be convinced that the post is accurate and will likely deny the suggestion.

Beatmappers regularly provide [kudosu](/wiki/kudosu) to mod posts that they agree with. This statistic is tracked on an individual's profile and is referenced when applying to join the [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/Beatmap_Nominators).

## Types of mod posts

The goal of each `Problem` or `Suggestion` post on a beatmap discussion is to explain anything concerning about a beatmap in the context of its design.

Many mod posts address mistakes in a beatmap. For example, a missing `Clap` hitsound which would be expected by the beatmap's hitsounding pattern is likely a mistake.

Providing alternative ways of beatmapping is another common type of mod post. While part of a beatmap may be acceptable in its current form, a modder can explain how to improve it further by designing it differently.

In beatmaps aiming for Ranked status, ensuring that they abide by the [Ranking Critera](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) is a must. A number of mod posts address issues cited directly from these criteria.
