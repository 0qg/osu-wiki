# MAT Leaders

During their existence, the [Mapping Assistance Team](/wiki/Modding/Mapping_Assistance_Team) (_MAT_) was overseen by a **MAT Leader** figure, responsible for managing and mentoring the team members, as well as raising awareness of important announcements and shaping the future goals and directions of the team.

[Ephemeral](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/102335) was chosen as the inaugural MAT Leader at the group's formation on the 29th of December, 2009.

The position was later held by [ztrot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6347) from the 26th of August 2010 until the dissolution of the Mapping Assistance Team on the 23rd of April, 2013 and the subsequent promotion of all current team members to the [Beatmap Appreciation Team](/wiki/Modding/Beatmap_Appreciation_Team) (_BAT_).
