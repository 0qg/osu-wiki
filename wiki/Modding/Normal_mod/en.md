# Normal mod

A **normal mod** (*NM*) is a [mod](/wiki/Modding) that will be provided without requiring any work from the requesting beatmapper. Normal mods are typically done to get second opinions on a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps) and help improve it. Many modders use the term "NM" to distinguish it from mod for mod exchanges.

Normal mods are most commonly requested on the forums in [modding queues](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/60), where modders can personalize which kind of beatmaps they want to see, and mappers can find people willing to help them improve their beatmaps.
