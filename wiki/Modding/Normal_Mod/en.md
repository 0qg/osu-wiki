# Normal mod

**Normal mods** (*NMs*) are [mods](/wiki/Modding/) that will be provided without requiring any work from the requesting beatmapper. Normal mods are usually done to get second opinions on a [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps/) and help improve it. The clarification word for normal mods might seem unnecessary, but modders use it to distinguish it from mod for mod exchanges.

Normal mods are most commonly requested on the forums in [modding queues](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/60). Here modders can personalize which kind of beatmaps they want to see, and mappers can find people willing to help them improve their beatmaps.
