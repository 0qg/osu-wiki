# Mapping Assistance Team

The Mapping Assistance Team (_MAT_) were a precursor group to the current [Beatmap Nominators](/wiki/People/The_Team/Beatmap_Nominators), responsible for assessing the quality of Pending beatmaps. MAT members were able to recommend maps deemed worthy for Ranked status to members of the [Beatmap Appreciation Team](/wiki/Modding/BAT) (_BAT_) by placing a [proto-bubble](/wiki/Modding/Protobubble), who would then evaluate the map and give a final decision on whether the beatmap should enter Ranked status.

In addition to co-operation with the Beatmap Appreciation Team, the MAT were overseen by a [MAT Leader](/wiki/Modding/MATLeaders) who oversaw their operation and provided guidance where necessary.

## History

The MAT was formed on the 27th of December, 2009, with initial members being hand-picked by members of the BAT.

Shortly afterwards, open applications were held, allowing all members of the general mapping and modding community to apply for a position in the Mapping Assistance Team. On the 26th of February, 2010, the first new batch of MAT members were added from these applicants, based on a collective evaluation from members of the Beatmap Appreciation Team and existing MAT. Further application cycles would be held regularly to scout for new members, as well as provide feedback to unsuccessful applicants.

On the 4th of October, 2010, members of the Mapping Assistance Team gained the ability to place full Bubble and Bubble Pop icons on beatmaps, bringing their roles and responsibilities more into line with their Beatmap Appreciation Team colleagues. However, they would still not possess forum or in-game chat moderation tools, and were to focus solely on evaluating and promoting beatmaps.

Following a gradual convergence of experience and responsibility between the two teams, on the 23rd of April, 2013, the Mapping Assistance Team was dissolved, with all current members being promoted to the Beatmap Appreciation Team and receiving the associated moderation tools and responsibilities.
