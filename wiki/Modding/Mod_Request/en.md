# Mod Request

A **mod request** is a term used when a beatmapper is in need of help and wants to improve their [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). This can be done in a multitude of ways but is most commonly done by requesting a normal mod or [mod for mod](/wiki/Modding/Mod_For_Mod) in one of the [forum modding queues](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/60). Once the mod request has been accepted the [modding](/wiki/Modding) process starts and the beatmap will be checked for potential mistakes and improvements.
