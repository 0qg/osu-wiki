# Kudosu

**Kudosu** is a reward system for [modding](/wiki/Modding). It awards points for successful mod posts on [beatmap discussion](/wiki/Beatmap_Discussion) pages. Accumulated points can be seen on a user's profile page.

In forum modding, kudosu was exchangeable for [star priority](/wiki/Glossary#star-priority).
