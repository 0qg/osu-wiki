# BAT Managers

Following the promotion of all active members of the [Mapping Assistance Team](/wiki/Modding/MAT) (_MAT_) to the [Beatmap Appreciation Team](/wiki/Modding/BAT) (also called the _Beatmap Approval Team_, or _BAT_), from the 15th of May, 2013, the BAT was overseen by a group of BAT Manager (_BATm_) figures, responsible for managing and mentoring the team members, as well as raising awareness of important announcements and shaping the future goals and directions of the team.

## History

Initially, one member of the BAT from each of the major geographical regions of The Americas ([Garven](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/244216)), Europe ([Kurai](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/77089)) and Asia ([NatsumeRin](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/151679)) was selected for this role.
