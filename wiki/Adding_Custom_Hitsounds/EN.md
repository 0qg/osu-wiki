Note
----

\***.mp3** is a placeholder! It is recommended that you use \***.wav** (but you can still use \***.mp3** anyways)!

Obtain the custom hitsounds
---------------------------

You first need some custom hitsounds.

-   You can get them from the [Custom Hitsound Library](Custom_Hitsound_Library "wikilink")
-   or make your own

Paste them into the song folder itself
--------------------------------------

If you don't know where your song folder is located, follow these directions

1.  Open osu!
2.  Edit
3.  Navigate to *your beatmap here* and open it
4.  Files (top-left menu, it is an off-white colored bar at the top)
5.  Open song folder
6.  *and paste them here*

Decide what type of sound they are
----------------------------------

This is importantâ€¦ sort of. Name them to what you want them to be, be it to be the **finish**, the **whistle**, the **clap** or just the **normal hit**.

Depending on which kind of hitsound you want it to fall under, you start the file name as **soft**, **normal** or **drum**.

You then decide if you want it to be the normal hit, clap, whistle or finish

### Example 1

So then you name the file (let's say the Soft clap) **soft-hitclap**.mp3

Multiple hitsounds with the same name
-------------------------------------

If you want more variety and need more options for clap and all, you just add a number behind it

### Example 2

like **normal-hitclap2**.mp3 or like **soft-hitfinish3**.mp3

Don't forget to go to the timing setup and change the hitsound choice to custom, and to the specific number
