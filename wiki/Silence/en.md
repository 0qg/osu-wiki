# Silence

A user that is **silenced** is limited in the things they were able to do. **Silences** can be placed by members of the [Global Moderation Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/4) and [Nomination Assessment Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/7)

## Limitations

- Cannot edit userpage
- Cannot change avatar/profile details <!-- unconfirmed on new site, but was a thing on old -->
- Cannot submit beatmaps
- Won't be able to send/receive private messages
- Cannot post on the forums

## Common reasons for silences

- Inappropriate behaviour in public chats and forums (including #multiplayer, beatmaps threads, discussions and comments)
    - This includes spamming, nonsense chat and racism etc.
- Uploading inappropriate content
    - Includes inappropriate avatars, beatmap submissions, profile details, userpage, banner and beatmap stealing.

The length of a silence may vary based on the severity of the infringement. Silences can stack on top of each other, adding more time for each one.
