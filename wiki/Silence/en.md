# Silence

A user that is **silenced** is limited in the things they were able to do. **Silences** can be placed by members of the [Global Moderation Team](<!-- link -->) and [Nomination Assessment Team](<!-- link -->)

## Limitations

<!-- what people can't do when silenced -->

## Common reasons for silences

- <!-- list of common reasons provided by pachiru ==> Inappropriate behavior in public chats and forums (including #multiplayer, beatmaps threads, discussions and comments), this includes spamming, nonsense chat, racism. Also, inappropriate avatar/beatmap submission/profile details/signature/userpage/banner and beatmap stealing! The length of the silence may vary depending on the gravity of the infrigement obviously. -->

An action taken against an user who spams the [chat console](/wiki/chat_console). Silences will stack on top of each other, adding more time for each one.

Silences lasts for 4 weeks before being reset, along with the time that gets added.

<!-- Not sure how accurate this is anymore, could use some confirmation as I'm sure there are more ways to get silenced nowadays -->
