# Installation

<!-- *See also: [Installation/OS X](/wiki/Installation/OS_X) and [Installation/Linux](/wiki/Installation/Linux)* -->

This page will roughly tell you how to get osu! working on your macOS device.

## Minimum system requirements

-   A decent computer running macOS.

## Installing osu!

-   The MacOS version of osu! is experimental. The game may not function properly or even boot at all. 

1.  Go to the unofficial [download page](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/682197) and download the installer.
2.  Locate the installer, right click, and select open.
    -   Double left clicking on the file may not open it, since MacOS may recognize the app as developed by an unidentified developer. Right clicking and selecting open will solve this problem.
3.  The installer will automatically run. The installation location cannot be changed and will be installed directly to `osu!.app`. Moving `osu.app` will move all of the files the come with it.
4.  When the installer is completed, osu! will start up right after. osu!direct will be used to download some starter beatmaps for you.
5.  osu! will prompt you to sign in or register.
    -   If you have an account already, sign in.
    -   If you need to register, see [Registration](/wiki/Registration), then sign in.

## Adding beatmapsets

*See also: [Beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmaps) and [Beatmapsets](/wiki/Beatmapsets)*

There are two ways to add beatmaps, via the website or osu!direct (requires [osu!supporter](/wiki/osu!supporter)).

### Website

1.  Go to the [beatmap listing page](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets) and sign in to the website.
2.  Find a song you like to play.
3.  Click on the download icon to save the beatmapset on your computer.
4.  Locate and open the beatmapset file, it has an `.osz` extension.
    -   Alternatively, you can also place the beatmapset file into the `Songs` directory, in the osu! package contents. This can be found by right clicking on osu! and selecting `Show Package Contents`.
5.  osu! will automatically handle the rest for you and load the beatmapset.
    -   If, for any reason, you do not see them, press `F5` in [Solo mode](/wiki/Solo_mode) to re-process your beatmaps.

### osu!direct

*Note: You need to have osu!supporter tag and internet connection to use osu!direct.*

1.  Open osu!, if you hadn't already.
2.  Find a song you like to play.
3.  Double click the the song on the list or click `Download` on the right to download it.
    -   If you do not want to download the video, click `DL NoVideo` instead.
4.  When osu! is done downloading the beatmapset, it will automatically load it if you are in Solo mode, at the [Song Selection](/wiki/Song_Selection) screen.
    -   If, for any reason, you do not see them, press `F5` in [Solo mode](/wiki/Solo_mode) to re-process your beatmaps.

## Adding skins

*See also: [Skins](/wiki/Skins) and [Skinning](/wiki/Skinning)*

1.  Go to the [skinning subforums](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/15) and find a skin you like.
2.  Once you find a skin, download it.
3.  Depending on how the skinner has packaged their skin, you may need to do different things.
    -   If the skin is using `.osk`:
        1.  Open it or drag and drop it into osu!.
        2.  osu! will process the skin and automatically select it for you.
    -   If the skin is compressed (using `.7z`, `.rar`, `.zip`, etc.):
        1.  Extract it.
        2.  Move the skin folder into the `Skins` directory of the osu! package contents.
        3.  If osu! is opened, you may need to restart it before the skin can be used.
        4.  In osu!, go to the [Options](/wiki/Options) and search for `Skin`.
        5.  Scroll down to the `Current skin:` option and select the skin you have downloaded.
