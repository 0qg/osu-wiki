# Banana

*Bananas* are bonus [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object) in a [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). Bananas are equivalent to the [spinner](/wiki/Hit_object/Spinner) in [osu!](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!), the difference being that you will always pass the bananas even when all bananas are missed.

Successfully catching a banana will result in an increase of [score](/wiki/Score) of 1100 points without taking [combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo) into account.
