# Fruit

*Fruits* are large coloured [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object) present in a [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). A hyperdash will be generated on a fruit once the next fruit or [drop](/wiki/Hit_object/Juice_stream#drop) is uncatchable by normal dashing.

Successfully catching a fruit will earn the player [score](/wiki/Score), increase the [combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo) by 1, provide a boost to the [health bar](/wiki/Glossary/Health_bar), and is treated as 300 in the result screen. If the player fails to catch a fruit it will result in a [combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo) break and a loss in [health](/wiki/Beatmapping/Health).
