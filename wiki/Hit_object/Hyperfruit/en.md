# Hyperfruit

A *hyperfruit* is an effect that can be generated on a [fruit](/wiki/Hit_object/Fruit) or [drop](/wiki/Hit_object/Juice_stream#drop). This effect will be generated when the next fruit or drop can't be catched with normal dashing. This effect will also generate when the last [banana](/wiki/Hit_object/Banana) of a spinner can't be caught with a dash. 

During play, this is characterized by a coloured outline on the first object.
