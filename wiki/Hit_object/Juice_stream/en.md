# Juice stream

*See also: [Score](/wiki/Score)*

**Juice streams** are an element in [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!catch) which include both drops and droplets. Juice streams are equivalent to [sliders](/wiki/Hit_object/Slider) in [osu!](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!).

## Drop

*Drops* are medium-sized coloured [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object) present in a [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). Drops are equivalent to slider ticks in [osu!](/wiki/Game_Modes/osu!). A hyperdash will be generated on a drop once the next [fruit](/wiki/Hit_object/Fruit) or drop is uncatchable by normal dashing.

Successfully catching a drop will earn the player a [score](/wiki/Score) of 100, increase the [combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo) by 1, provide a small boost to the [health bar](/wiki/Glossary/Health_bar), and is treated as 100 in the result screen. If the player fails to catch a drop it will result in a [combo](/wiki/Beatmapping/Combo) break and a loss in [health](/wiki/Beatmapping/Health).

## Droplet

*Droplets* are small coloured [hit objects](/wiki/Hit_object) present in a [osu!catch](/wiki/Game_mode/osu!catch) [beatmaps](/wiki/Beatmap). 

Successfully catching a droplet will earn the player a [score](/wiki/Score) of 10, provide a small boost to the [health bar](/wiki/Glossary/Health_bar), and is treated as 50 in the result screen. If the player fails to catch a droplet it will result in a loss in [health](/wiki/Beatmapping/Health).
