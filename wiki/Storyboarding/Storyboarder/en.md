# Storyboarder

A **storyboarder** is a term used to describe a user who makes storyboards for their own, or someone else's [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). Storyboarders use the beatmap editor's Design section, a third party application, or [storyboard scripting](/wiki/storyboard_scripting) to create [storyboards](/wiki/Storyboards).

<!-- TODO: Possibly can be expanded with links to noteable storyboarders and their impact on the game -->
