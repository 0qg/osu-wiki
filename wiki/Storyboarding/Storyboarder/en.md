# Storyboarder

A storyboarder refers to the user who makes storyboards for their own or someone else's [beatmap](/wiki/Beatmaps). They may have used the editor's design section to [storyboard](/wiki/Storyboards), used a third party application, or have done [storyboard scripting](/wiki/storyboard_scripting) (or SBS).
