Howdy, Spotlight chasers!

As many of you are already aware, the Summer Season 2020 is over, and we are here to finally announce the **beginning of Autumn Season 2020**, with new features and updates frequently asked by the community!

After listening to your feedback, we expect this season to be dynamic, slightly faster, more diverse and balanced. With those things in mind, we modified timeshift lobby durations and finally added mods! Check out in details what we have planned for this season:

### League-related aspects:

- **Lobbies will be open for the whole week.** We realized that making the timeshift lobbies only available on the weekends is difficult for a lot of players interested in participating our league system and thus we will now keep it open for the whole week instead, starting by tomorrow.
- **Some playlists will now feature mods.** A fundamental part for a diverse gameplay is to add mods, especially if we want to give skilled players a bit more of a challenge! But do not worry about having your favourite song or map featured as a mod-only difficulty. All maps that feature mods will also have their original version available. We want to keep it fair and fun for everyone!

  *osu!taiko will not be able to feature mods this season due to lazer limitations*

### General aspects:

- **The best mappers of each season will be rewarded**. Players are not the only fundamental aspect of each season, maps and mappers are also very important to the whole system. With that in mind, we decided mappers will also get their own spotlight! The rewards are going to be explained below in more details.

## Mappers of the Season

A new feature we would like to announce is that we will now start to reward mappers for their excellency with **3 months of osu!support**! After each season is over, the curators will handpick a mapper from the curated pool for each gamemode and they will be featured as the best mapper of the season.


We still plan to bring more rewards as seasons keep progressing and improving.

Thank you for always making awesome and spotlight-worthy beatmaps!

## The Future

As much as we would love to announce a bunch of new amazing features, the new Beatmap Spotlights is still a project on its early development stage and depends a lot on community feedback and engagement to improve. Many things can change and enhancements can be done for future seasons, and it all depends on *your* feedback!

What do you want for the next season? What needs to be fixed? What are your opinions on the current system? You can voice out all your opinions [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1157947) and we will keep note of every suggestion, always seeking for improvement.

We do hope you have enjoyed the Summer Season 2020, and, of course, we do hope that you enjoy the Autumn Season even more. See you in the upcoming timeshift lobbies!
