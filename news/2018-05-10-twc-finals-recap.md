With only 6 remaining teams, the past weekend gave us some of the most intense matches yet, which were amplified even more by the evil mappool. Read more to catch up and get ready for the epic Grand Finals stage!

**Note: Team United States were disqualified due to one of their players cheating and thus, all of their matches this stage were nullified, resulting in Indonesia winning over them by default.**

### Finals Matches

**In the first match, Canada claimed their top 4 placing by taking down South Korea 7-3.** The Koreans dominated the speedy nomod picks [Nanoka - Tsukimade Todoke, Fushi no Kemuri](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/763774#taiko/1605963) and [Lily - Scarlet Rose](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/195238#taiko/463330), but that only got them so far. Still though, give it up for South Korea for even reaching Finals despite being mid seeded and having such a limited roster. Just imagine what they could accomplish with a bigger roster in future cups...

History was repeated and made at the same time in the classic top 2 matchup between Japan and Taiwan in the winners bracket. Japan 
won the match 7-3, but they lost more maps in a match than ever before. If Taiwan rematches Japan in the Grand Final next week and adapts well to the mappool, they might be able to steal a few more points or maybe even the match, only time will tell.


It has been quite the year for Canada, and [janitoreihil](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3307897) will give us some perspective on their cup experience with the help of some teammates:

"Despite some shaky performances and notelocks on a few maps, everyone on the team is still quite satisfied overall with our placement and performances throughout the tournament. This year, the mantle of team captain was given to vladyushko, who did a lot to organize the team, whether it be scores, scheduling, or even just moral support. The most surprising member of the team this year was definitely [-Yuno-], who showed a great deal of improvement from the previous year and proved to be a key player for several of the Hard Rock and gimmicks picks throughout the tournament. 

This year proved to be a slight disappointment in some matches, as we ended up losing to Taiwan, our long-time rivals. Even though we did end up having an amazing match against Hong Kong in the Semifinals, taking revenge for our defeat last year, the victory was a little bittersweet due to their shortage of players this year. Nonetheless, the team enjoyed the pools and matches overall, even with some of the more... interesting picks (Nosso Samba, anyone?), and we look forward to the further development of the Taiko World Cup next year."

### Finals Mappool

There was bound to be diversity in the picks, since teams required a whole 7 map wins in order to win in this stage. Despite that, the FreeMod map [The Flashbulb - Passage D](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/587426/#taiko/1243907) has yet to be played, but that might change this weekend. Considering the low amount of matches, the 8 bans were also spread out in the sense that one map from every mod bracket got banned atleast once. As the work for the mappool selectors this year has come to an end, here are the closing comments of one of them:

[mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718):

""It may come as a surprise to you that the Finals Mappool was the second mappool we started work on, immediately following Group Stage. This was done as a precaution to avoid having a repeat of the thermal runaway mappool that almost killed everyone last year. In spite of this, the Finals Mappool still ended up being extremely difficult – perhaps even more challenging than last year. We are thankful to have started this early, as it gave us more time to ensure the balance of the mappool.

With regards to the matches last weekend, I’m certainly glad to see a fairly even spread of picks across the board. “Nanoka - Tsukimade Todoke, Fushi no Kemuri” was probably my greatest oversight – I had seriously underestimated the difficulty it would pose on the players. Otherwise, I am seriously impressed with how players are coping with this mappool – their stellar performances exceeding my expectations more times than I can count. I eagerly await for more surprises in the upcoming final weekend matches!”"
