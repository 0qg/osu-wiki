Sweeping the drum & bass scene, **Fred V & Grafix** arrives as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/180/header.jpg)

Innovators in their scene since their launch 10 years ago, **Fred V & Grafix** is a duo best known for their musical diversity within the bounds of drum & bass. Drawing influence from sources outside the scope of usual drum & bass like funk, soul, rock, and jazz, their music introduces new forms of instrumentation that you can't find from any other producers in the scene. So yeah, they're pretty cool.

We picked up **7** tracks from their catalogue featuring a wide selection of guest vocalists, all of which are up for grabs from [**Fred V & Grafix**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/180)!

While the duo split in 2018 so each producer could pursue their own solo careers, the osu! community continues to carry the legacy of their collaborative works through awesome beatmaps. Check them out and maybe map some for yourself:
