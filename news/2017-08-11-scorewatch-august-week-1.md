Even though several top players have travelled to China this week, things are still taking shape back in the servers! Another player has joined the 700pp club, a special SS set on a difficult osu!mania map, and much more in this edition of Scorewatch!

[_RyuK](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/6304246) has broken into the 700pp club! The number 1 Canadian set his mark on the famous map [kradness&Reol - Remote Control](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/774965?m=0) and taking an outstanding 97.76% HDDT 1 miss score to earn an amazing 704pp score! Well, I don’t think I need to write much more for this score. Have a look!

An unfamiliar face to newcomers, but definitely a player that has not rusted a bit! [Niko](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/175141) has come back strong with an amazing 98.59% S rank on [Tatsh - IMAGE -MATERIAL- <Version 0>](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/252238), taking the 7th only no mod S on this map, with an accuracy that even beat out [rrtyui](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/352328} himself! What a comeback from this amazing player!

[HappyStick](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/256802) has produced an incredible score on [Tech N9ne - Worldwide Choppers](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/345189?m=0), in fact, getting the first ever no mod S on the map and the No. 1 spot with a 98.79% 2225x combo play to earn 372pp. What a shame that an FC could have happened, but nonetheless, enjoy this livestream moment!

[shinchikuhome](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/3174184) snatched an amazing 97.54% DT FC on the recently ranked [BL-Records - Midway Colors](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/beatmap?b=1251769&m=1) to take away an impressive 656pp score. Yes, this is 270bpm. And yes, this is absolutely insane.

[jakads](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/259972) has finally taken the second SS on [Colorful Sounds Port - ETERNAL DRAIN](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1001780?m=3), taking the number one spot on the map and 646pp in the process! He may has not been the first one to take the 100% accuracy, but his ratio is definitely the best amongst everyone.

NOTABLE MENTIONS

[WubWoofWolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/39828) has shocked the osu! community with an amazing play on [Halozy - Genryuu Kaiko](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/433005)! Slapping on the HD mod, he went on to take an incredible 99.15% HD 4 miss score to land 4th on the leaderboards and even earn 408pp in the process! Wolf at its finest.

Don’t underestimate this play! [ThePooN](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/718454) has just set a crazy 98.48% 13x miss 1797 combo score on the hardest 8.03* difficulty of [And Aoiyuuki - I love Flezlin](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/525461). Note that this map has big jumps (and not only) throughout the whole map!
