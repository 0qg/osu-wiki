**[RLC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1047883)** easily took the top spot at this month's spotlight with this beautiful marathon. Reminding us of his previous masterpieces such as Anhedonia, the music offers a lot of variety and interesting rhythms over the course of more than 10 minutes. Every track of the gapless album is mapped differently, but the map still feels coherent and polished throughout. Totally worth checking out.

**[sionKotori](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1083407)** continues to impress with his newly ranked map, full of very interesting patterns which fit very well with the song and look amazing, other than giving a pretty cool sense of speed. Recommended for everyone who enjoys technical and slider-heavy maps!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/glass-no-kutsu.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/585681)

Taking a spot in almost every spotlight lately, **[Delis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1603923)** has made it again. This time, combining the exceptional flow and stunning variety they are known for with an emotional song by Ito Kanako. The mapping perfectly represents the impactful changes of intensity provided by the song. This map is an experience you won't regret!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/bellow.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/504315)

Doubles and low BPM songs are kind of rare nowadays, but fortunately we have **[TicClick](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/672931)**! Providing us with a fairly simple yet effective interpretation, he manages to keep us going with the up-beat rhythm this music genre provides. Whether you are experienced or just started out playing the game you can bet there's something for you to enjoy, thanks to the low BPM allowing you to try out various mod combinations even at lower stages. This doesn't mean you should underestimate the set either though: some passages may turn out being trickier than expected. Definitely worth giving this mapset a try if you're looking for something unusual.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/ben-se.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/567325)

This beatmap set truly stands out due to the unique spacing and patterning in both difficulties. The flow is smooth but expressive, perfectly supporting the mood of the song. **[09kami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/443031)**'s and **[Crystal](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1646397)**'s maps are on a similar difficulty level, but represent the song in different ways. Check out both of them, you will not regret it!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/kokoronashi.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/565432)

Kokoronashi is yet another great mapset created by **[pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418)**. The Insane completely avoids circular flow and instead makes use of linear and zig-zag movements, creating a unique gameplay experience. The lower difficulties mirror the concepts of the highest one, so the spread feels very coherent. You should definitely check this one out if you haven't yet!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/yuki-no-hana.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/565432)

A calm, beautiful winter song with a very good-looking skin and a very well designed mapset by **[Lan Wings](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/467860)**. While the top difficulty is quite spammy in terms of object density, the visual aspect of the map does not fall apart! Combined with great lower difficulties, this mapset deserves to be featured in the spotlights.

## osu!taiko

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/classic-pursuit.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/373254)

Spooky! Just 7 months after Halloween, **[Hanjamon](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/1703330)**'s Classic Pursuit entered the ranked section, and what a great map it is! Featuring a huge variety of Slider Velocity changes, tricky off-beat patterns, consistency (which does not equal boring) and even 1/8, this map offers a lot of things to enjoy. And if the map is too easy for you: Try it with ANY mod. It's a challenge with Hidden, Hardrock and DoubleTime, with the variety of Slider Velocities and complex 1/4+1/8 keeping you on your toes no matter what mod you are using.

The set also has nicely done lower diffs, including his signature "Basic" difficulty, which introduces you into the most basic structures of osu!taiko's dons and kats (the red and blue notes!).

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/proof-of-existence.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/427864)

What a high quality set brought up by **[tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767)** and **[SKSalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3280542)** this month! What made this chart get featured in the Spotlights is the management of a flawless structure, patterning and flow in each of their respective difficulties, really contrasting with some other ranked maps this month. tasuke912's pair patterns usage and rhythm changes in the Inner Oni is the signature of a very highly experienced beatmapper, representing the song extremely accurately while making it fun to play through flow and hitsounding.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/on-the-fm.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/568544)

This month we have something different in the chart, a gimmick map! Tired of maps with regular Slider Velocity? Do you want to play maps with constant speed changes? On the FM it's your map! But hey, we are talking of the Inner Oni, right? No! You will have a SV challenge in all diffs, even in the Kantan. **[Nofool](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/672430)** did a good choice with this song as the speed changes fits pretty well and gives a lot of variety, since 1/4 patterns to nonstop 1/3 patterns. What? Too slow? Use HardRock and you will enjoy more the map!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/clarity.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/603069)

A bright song and map that should be mentioned in this month, it doesn't contained any fancy patterns, but rather clean in overall. Although the usage of hitsounds is decent, it still not the most decisive element to make this map perfect. The volume setting is also a important factor that make patterns andhitsounds completely integrated with the song. To summarize, this map is made in a very interesting way, with the volume and hitsound usage strongly highlighting **[hikikkochan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6512678)**'s comprehsion of the song's cadence and direction.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/elpis.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/559260)

After having his [first ever ranked map](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/507007) featured in the Spotlights at the start of the year, **[iloveyou4ever](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4964596)**'s unique mapping style continues to impress, and his latest map ELPIS certainly showcases his growing creativity and talent as a mapper. This kind of progression is exactly the kind we are looking for, and thus he has earned a rightful spot on this month's Spotlights!

The key defining feature of this map lies in its excellent choice of patterns. In particular, the placement of triplets is nothing short of beautiful, as it captures the swell and subtle nuances of the song very well. The streams throughout the map are also fairly varied, carrying good flow in spite of the fluctuating BPM. All in all another excellent addition to the ranked section, and I personally cannot wait to see more from him!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/best-day.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/316779)

A solid mapset in this month, from Kantan to Muzukashii, **[Volta](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4154071)** did very good job by following a lot of instrument(including vocal) and assigned drum and beat as main role to maintain the map's structure, then used other one like vocal to decorate the map to make the map become more fun to play. Moreover, **[Nardoxyribonucleic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/876419)**'s Oni also decent, every hitsounds usage mapped in the best way. After looking how perfect Oni is, I just wonder how Inner Oni can be mapped in good way by expanding the note's density, but I am totally wrong, it indeed contains much more notes expansion and has a lot of continuous 1/2+1/4 patterns, but every 1/2 hitsounds are correct mapped and every 1/4 patterns placed in perfect section. Furthermore, he used some harder 1/4 pattern to make the map more fun to play. I would say that I enjoy this map very much!

## osu!catch

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/chronoxia.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/429184)

Our top pick is something that many osu!catch players would be familiar with due to it being selected for the osu!catch World Cup 2016's Finals mappool, and is now a fully ranked map. Both the Overdose made by **[Furely](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/853694)** and the Chronos difficulty feature patterns that we don't usually see in most ranked maps - strict antiflow patterns, high overall spacing, and generally a lot of places to miss - while still making it a fun mapset of fair difficulty.

Overall, the map is quite challenging for its star rating, being harder than other mapsets people usually see in the Ranked category. It also features several mappers, providing players with different styles across all difficulties. It's quite the engaging map, and one that could surely make you wiggle from joy!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/shelter.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/536749)

Despite this set is being **[Myle](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4915649)**'s very first ranked set it came out to be a really enjoyable one. The spread built up to grew quite constantly. He learned how to make the rhythm to be consistent and yet still provide variable patterns in a short time. The flow of the difficulties are just splendid and perfectly executed. The Platter is really made for the targeted audience, he held back with the HyperJumps and only placed one where it should be which gives better impact in overall and feels really good. It was really enjoying to play, he made a good work!

## osu!mania

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/trigger.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/555076)

This beatmap set by **[Wonki](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7898495)** definitely is a fun experience from the ranked pool and congratulations to Wonki for winning this month spotlights and also for providing us such a good piece. The scroll speed changes on this map feels intense but they are not overdone and it just feels natural with the song, making it really confortable to play. Combine that with a cool usage of minijacks at the very end with some simple long note patterns this map just has everything you want to be the map of the month... and its art!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/re-lm.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/588066)

This map has a heavy use of scroll speed changes, which are thoughtfully crafted to be intuitive and smooth. It is quite impressive given how easy to cross the line of being more of a distraction than a feature. Although the scroll speed change is particularly not the reason why this map is deserve to be in the Spotlights. **[Lude](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6974536)** doesn't shy away from long note usage in their mapping of this track. Instead, he use it to add atmospheric value, complexity and originality, which is great to see. These two points combined with some enjoyable jack-oriented mapping and very smooth difficulty curves, makes this a suitable pick for May's spotlight.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/black-or-white.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/565779)

Let me introduce you another extreme 7K marathon map by **[Kawawa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4647754)**. Pleasure to the eye how the map structure flows nicely with the song intensity. He has a really good experience in term of emphasizing the melody itself. What caught my attention is the jacking style pattern in the map which it is pretty new and interesting to see. Besides giving a great pattern usage, the speed change through the map are astonishing extreme and fun.

He did a good job on highlighting certain beats magnitude with a suitable slider velocity. By advancing through the map, player could easily experience the consciousness of the music along with the note arrangement emphasized by the mapper intention. Have a try while you are on it.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/shine.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/456289)

For his 5th ranked map, **[Frim4503](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2945775)** offers us another 5K marathon, this time for a drum & bass love live opening remix!
As usual, the usage of long notes and chords play really well, making it a really fun map to try big accuracy scores. Scroll speed changes are lightly used with a quite unique style, focus on the voice before each kiai time. Without changing much of music/mapping style, he shows us one more time that anti-meta is not dead with a really accessible and catchy map.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2017-06-27-beatmap-spotlights-may-2017/doppelganger.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/s/407153)

While this set is being a hard one in osu!mania, it comes with a really enjoyable and challenging patterns in every single difficulty. We also have a few guest difficulties coming from **[Evening](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2193881)**, **[jakads](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/259972)** and **[Lude](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6974536)**. Evening's chart is not really overtly heavy, but watch out for the scroll speed changes! They're way more noticeable in this difficulty than in the other ones. Every single mapper and modder has done a really good job checking the pattern's quality and playability of each difficulty (even though Alter Ego is hell itself, someone with a good eye can really see how good the patterns fits with the song).

--------

And that just about covers the Spotlights for April. We hope you enjoy the new template graphics for each chart, and we hope you look forward to what we have in store next month as well!
