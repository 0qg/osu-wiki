Our project is called Beatmap Pack Management and while it isn't official yet, we still put a lot of effort and time into development of Beatmap Packs. Many of you might not even know who we are and what we are doing, so I'd like to present to you some information about us:

I've created a small group of experienced users who are interested to work on handmade charts dedicated to a specific theme, idea, or share similarities. And so we've been actively working since July 2019 to provide new theme packs of decent quality with interesting concepts. The interest is very high and some noteworthy members of the community joined the group to help me substantiate their ideas in this project. We already have a few things to present to you, and I am sure you'll like them.

### Alternator Style packs

lain was passionated enough to work on the very first mapping-style-specific mappacks that has been released in the packlist, and focused on beatmaps where alternating is essential. He has worked on two versions, one with ranked maps and one purely with loved beatmaps. If you need maps to practice alternating or are good already and want to challenge yourself you should check these packs out!

### The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil pack

Available to download now is the first of the Touhou Game Packs, where a selection of various Touhou maps from a specific game are picked and curated just for you! This first pack contains beatmaps from the first non PC-98 Touhou game and the sixth game in the series, Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. The packs aims to offer a variety of styles and themes, ranging from 2008 to 2018 to offer something to enjoy for anyone. Packs for future games are currently being worked on and should be released within the next few weeks. Enjoy!

### Best of 2010–2011 pack

Ever wanted to see what popular maps looked like in earlier eras of the game? Well now you can! Forged together by members of the Beatmap Pack Management team, you can check out some of the best maps that the game had to offer during 2010 and 2011 in one single pack. While there were a lot of great maps the team didn't have enough room to include, hopefully you can find something on this list that you will enjoy. Play through them all and experience a blast from the past!

### osu!dan project

*written by [celerih](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4696296)*

The osu!dan project is a brand new community created project that seeks to provide a sort of ‘campaign mode’ to the game. Players will progress through levels of increasing difficulty in a skill of their choice, such as aim, stamina, accuracy, et cetera.

Each of the dans will contain 20 levels, each of increasing difficulty. In order to complete a level, the player must reach the requirements on the maps presented, like reaching a certain accuracy threshold or attaining a full combo. For now, the release of dan levels is purely for fun, a way to practice, or testing yourself, but a more official implementation is planned for the future. wink wink

The first of the dans is now available to download on the beatmap packs page of this site. The skill tested in this first release is aim and is sure to push your circle clicking limits. The requirements for this dan are quite simple; just full combo 10 of the 11 maps in a level to progress to the next. Once again, this for now is just for your own practice, or to compare yourself with your friends - there is no implementation for keeping track of levels as of now.

### October Loved packs

*written by [Stefan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/626907)*

As it is time again to bundle a few beatmaps, there are some new packs for loved beatmaps available since yesterday. I want to take the chance to explain why I do not bundle the latest maps from Loved already: Since there is always a small chance that a beatmap can become unloved (and therefore unranked) it's a bit tedious to keep track of these things and I decided to give maps at least a minimum of 10 months to stay in Loved, and to bundle them afterwards into packs. While it's no guarantee they will stay in Loved forever, it works for me and I'll go by that for now. Changes can always happen though and I am open for alternatives.

### What else to expect

While I believe we're doing very well already, we're just about to start and currently I'm the only active person that coordinates the uploads, as well as the accessibility and maintenance of the packs so it's a bit slow. But I'm glad I could help a lot of people so far and that I have received so much great feedback. If you are interested to take a look in what we are working on, or if you have to report an error/bug in a pack you can join our project server and spectate our doings. Alternatively, if you are interested to work in the group you can join it too! Please check out the [thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/933379) for information on how to get to the server.

I can also recommend to follow [@osuMapPacks](https://twitter.com/osuMapPacks) on Twitter to stay updated with news, fixes, new packs and more. With that said, I can't really tell when the next news post will follow since we're a group that takes time to work on packs individually but you can still contact me for questions if you have any. And I hope you have an amazing day and download lotsa packs, thank you for reading.
