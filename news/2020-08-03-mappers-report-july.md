Good news, everyone! We think we've perfected a news post that will inform you about everything mapping and modding related going on in osu! 

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/the-mappers-report.jpg)

This month's issue of the Mappers' Report contains the following topics:

- **[Ranking Criteria Changes](#rc-changes)**
- **[Within the Beatmap Nominators and NAT](#within-bn-nat)**
- **[Mappers' Showcase](#mappers-showcase)**
- **[Mapping Contests](#mapping-contests)**
- **[Conclusion](#conclusion)**

## <a id="rc-changes"></a>Ranking Criteria Changes

For this month, there weren't many major proposals or Ranking Criteria changes, rather the focus was on minor wording changes.

### osu!taiko
 
- **[Change the wording for "patterns faster than"](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1097738)**: This change aims to clear up some ambiguity in the wording of a futsuu difficulty-specific rule.

### osu!mania

- **[Redefining the "stream" terminology](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1079647])**: Another change mainly looking to make the terminology in the mania Ranking Criteria as clear as possible. This change defines the length at which a pattern is considered a stream.
- **[Change chord guidelines in normal difficulties](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1067554)**: This is the only non-wording based change this month. This change, with regards to 4K and 7K normals difficulties, allows mappers to use chords during a long note hold as long as it's being played with the other hand.

## Open Ranking Criteria Proposals

As every month we keep you up to date with the changes to the Ranking Criteria. All rule and guideline changes are listed below, and in addition, you can see open proposals to give your feedback!

### All Modes

- **[Treat official romanisation above RC standardisation](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1095833)**
- **[Avoid spoilers in maps](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1083667)**
- **[Clear metadata rules and add guidelines regarding mashups](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1108054)**

### osu!catch

- **[Remove "clear dashes" guideline on Platter difficulties](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1118458)**

### osu!mania

- **[Change some duplicated phrases in 7K hard guidelines](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1112674)**

## <a id="within-bn-nat"></a>Within the Beatmap Nominators and NAT

New Beatmap Nominators have arrived! As every month, we would like to show you who you can request your pending maps to. Just make sure to request them to the Beatmap Nominators of the right mode. Below, a list of all additions and departures of this month!

But before we get to them, we have some important announcements to make for the so-called "care package" which had its first test run some months ago in osu!taiko and a change regarding Beatmap Nominator applications and evaluations.

### Activity lenience for returning Beatmap Nominators

Have you ever been a Beatmap Nominator before and would like to make your return? Then we have great news! In the [February issue of the Mappers' Report](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2020-02-28-mappers-report-february) we have mentioned that we applied a "care package" for osu!taiko that gave past Beatmap Nominators an easier way to make their return. Now the time has come that we will apply it for all game modes! And it starts with this announcement!
Following rules apply for the activity lenience:

- **You must have been a member of the Beatmap Nominators in the past**. This applies back to the date when the Beatmap Nominators were first created. (Past BAT times). This means that you will only need **two months** of modding activity in order to apply!
- **You must have been a member of the Beatmap Nominators in the past year**. Additionally you must have left on "good terms". On "good terms" means that you have passed your last evaluation. If both apply to you, you will only need **one month** of modding activity in order to apply!

This has been tested on leaving Beatmap Nominators for a few months already, so you may already have this leniency if you've left recently.
We've got your interest? Great! When you are sure that the activity lenience can be applied to you, contact any member of the Nomination Assessment Team! (Preferably of your game mode, because they will most likely know if you were a Beatmap Nominator in the past.)

### BN application and evaluation results will now be sent via chat

Next, the NAT has an important announcement to make regarding future Beatmap Nominator evaluations and applications. As you may know, all results used to be delivered through legacy pm on the old osu! website. **This is no longer the case**. You will now receive a message through the website/in-game chat function once your application or evaluation has concluded. This message will contain a link that will lead you to the **Beatmap Nominator website**, where more detailed feedback can be viewed. 

And now let's go to the team movements for this month:

### BN Additions

- **osu!:** [-Aqua](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7150015), [Bibbity Bill](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4446810), [Log Off Now](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4378277) & [C00L](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4930630)
- **osu!catch:** [wonjae](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5032045) & [-Joni-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9988837)

- **osu!catch:** [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508)

## <a id="mappers-showcase"></a>Mappers' Showcase

Another month, another Mappers' Showcase! However, "mapper" is maybe not the right term this time. Since we covered the first round of all game modes, we thought we'd make something special this time. We would like to show you the work of storyboarders!
As storyboarding can apply to all game modes, we thought it'd be the perfect moment to showcase some outstanding storyboarders this month!

This month got covered by [Walavouchey](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5773079) with two excellent storyboarder picks!

### ohm002

Having made quite a few storyboards in only the short span of, well, this year, [ohm002](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4468239) has been building up their repertoire trying out a lot of different ideas. While being newer in the scene, they have managed some rather quick improvement that aspiring storyboarders might want to take note of!

In their first ranked storyboard for [Halozy - Paranoid Lost](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1180913#osu/2462333), ohm002 goes big and bold with lots of contrast between sections of the song. While not the cleanest in the technicalities, it sure gives a shocking impression and a unique playing experience.

In contrast, their recent work for [HAG - Rokugatsu no Himitsu Kichi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1094362#osu/2287170) shows a rather clean and concise style with less particle effects. They demonstrate how a simple style can look good when you get the fundamentals right. There's clearly a lot of potential here and we look forward to seeing their future works!

### PantyDev

As a long time storyboarder, [PantyDev](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5420543) has an impressive variety in their portfolio. With storyboards ranging from simple and clean to complex and ambitious, they might just have the experience to compete with the best.

A unique one would definitely be their visualization for [BoxPlot - Tramontane](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1016398#osu/2127254), basically turning the whole background into a swaying curtain. Certainly a neat concept that not many storyboards use, but it may feel a bit dizzying.

Another great storyboard of theirs is the one for [Krewella - Killin' It (Sped Up Ver.)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1029940#osu/2153590), featuring smooth background movement, flashing lights, chromatic aberration, and a whole lot more that makes one background absolutely pop.

Lastly, their work for [ClariS - SHIORI](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/747684#osu/1575386) is one of the more ambitious storyboards to hit the community. The different sections with their own cute details make the whole thing feel more like a music video than a storyboard.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg! Be sure to check out some of their many storyboards on other maps!

Do you know any mapper or storyboarder who is rather unknown and makes awesome content? Then make sure to let us know! Submit them through [this form](https://forms.gle/kM5SW33xp1HttS7D8) today!

## <a id="mapping-contests"></a>Mapping Contests

Now, I hope you're ready because we're back with more news and information on the latest mapping contests happening right now, with more juicy details on results from concluding contests, and where you can participate in new and upcoming mapping contests!

### Monthly Beatmapping Contests

The screening phase for July's MBC is well underway! The limitation this month was **the circle size must be 0**. Best of luck to all the mappers who entered!

As for results, results for both May and June's MBC have been announced, including the announcement of the first winner of the MBC grand prize!

May's contest concluded with 2 winners! Congratulations to both [hypercyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9155377) who won both the community vote and "screening crew's favourite" categories, and to [Acylica](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1943309) who was the community vote's runner-up! Further congratulations to [hypercyte](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9155377) on being the first mapper to have won the MBC grand prize and earning the **Elite Mapper** title through the new Monthly Beatmapping Contests with an overall total of 7 points!

As for June, we congratulate [Kalibe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3376777), [xbopost](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6842421) and [Sylas](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3906405) on winning MBC for this month! There was a 3-way tie this time so there will be no runner-up for this month. The scores between their entries were so thin, with an amazing display of work from all three of them. [Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515) and [K4L1](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11334594) also received honorable mentions for their creative entries which unfortunately did not score as high.

And that's it for this month! We decided to not include the "Around the Community" section this time because we haven't heard of anything that would fit into it. 

Now to some in-house advertising, we have moved! Prior to the move, we had our home on the Beatmap Nominator discord server, but now we've decided to move to the [osu! Community Server](https://discord.gg/0Vxo9AsejDkGlk3H). Should you be interested to help us out with future issues of the Mappers' Report or have anything you would like us to include, you can find us there in the #mappers-report channel! 

Hope to see you there soon, thank you for reading and stay safe and healthy!

—Feerum, Teky, Walavouchey & hypercyte
