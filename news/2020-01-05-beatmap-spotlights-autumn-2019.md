[Beomsan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3626063) and [Down](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4694602) here to show how detailed a map could be. In their mapset of Nekomata Master+’s “POINT ZERO”, every pitch change and variation in intensity is perfectly represented, with the constant changes in spacing and the high contrast between slider velocities. But that’s just the beginning.

To accompany the spontaneous piano and the jumbled background percussions near the end, the map strives to portray every bit of the music. Irregular patterns kick in, increasing the intensity of the beatmap to match the music. Such a chaotic piece being depicted in such a chaotic fashion, it’s without question that this should be added to your collection.

Do you need to map literally everything when you want to follow a song in the best way? [Mirash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2841009) and [PandaHero](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1233255) proved, in their new mapset onumi - ARROGANCE, that you don't need to at all. Pairing with their representative style which uses iconic slider shapes and various dope overlap patterns inserting strict geometrics, this mapset brings out onumi's experimental electronic song's hidden potential by largely and intentionally undermap at many spots, especially at the beginning, the transition parts in the middle and the end. 

They follow the general vibe of the background instrumental ignoring the drums - sometimes even dropping the whole section - which can force players positively to notice every single layer's detail and thus represent the whole song in a clearer multilayer level, instead of blindly trying to follow everything in this complex song, which could possibly turn out to become a mess and failed to represent the song logically. Besides, carefully chosen hitsounds also largely help to improve the overall playing experience of this whole set. 

If you are getting bored by maps that placing objects on every single sound, this mapset would bring you a huge surprise without doubt.

Being a fanatic of Nekomata Master’s music tracks, [Icekalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5410645) decided to compile some of their best in Instrumental Compilation. He portrays every track excerpt as thoroughly as possible, putting in 1/6 trills, long chains of low bpm streams, varying slider velocity constantly, keeping the map very engaging.

On top of this, he also invited mappers [ScubDomino](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8972308), [den0saur](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5385151), [Xilver15](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3099689) and [celerih](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4696296) to map a few of the songs as well, with each of their own unique styles to represent their respective songs.

If you have enough time, be sure to check this one out!

A wild [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) appeared on Spotlight!

Shadowmaker, made by pishifat, would be able to described into one sentence; it shows how various / diverse a map can be. Each notable section is represented very well and all of them have their own strong characteristics and gimmick. For example, when the section where the guitar goes really intense and climax, the map does it too. It goes more intense than any sections the map had and they spectacularly succeed to represent the song. 

Not only those efforts to try to show various styles, but also it overall is based on a certain strong style so that patterns do not go weird when connected sequentially. For example, the map consists of a really consistent structure through each section and it helps to make each pattern sometimes homogeneous but sometimes creative too. "that style" also just goes its own way when we are recently full of newer / different styles which is appreciable!

To mention the other gimmick / interesting thing the map has, it is impossible not to mention the Slider Velocity changes. As you can see in the editor, there's a lot of green lines (inherent timing points) and most of them are mainly for slider velocity changes!  By this I mean that the mapper tried a lot of Slider Velocity combinations through numerous trial and errors to find the optimal ones, which takes a lot of effort and is cute too! Especially at the build-up part before alternator style section, you will see that the speed changes are fluctuating really frequently that sometimes it drops from 4.00x to 1.50x. This is very nice and interesting decision in terms of that these patterns try to capture literally every feature from the song. For example, the map uses really high SV when factors such as guitar, snare sound, etc. are mixed whereas when the beat has monotonous participants it only provides slow SV which is really representing the song well! To consider all of those, there's absolutely no way that this map will fail to amaze you.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-05-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/osu/alde.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/607948)

Have you ever wanted something special for your special day? you came here correctly! I proudly present to you sakyzyo - Aldebaran mapped by [Ellyu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4438154).

The map mostly keeps a visually polished and balanced structure. It features a lot of blankets and even using the sliders themselves which is really pleasing to look at. Keeping 1/4 sections spaced rather than stacking which is regular and trying to use the various spacing and sliders simultaneously the map went good and really fun to play at the same time. Also, besides these, the mapper puts the effort on making sliders visual gimmicks, mainly during the kiai when the rapid 1/8 roll sound appears they tried to emphasize them by curving and adding a lot of tumors or keeping the slider into a specific shape than just adding another 1/8 roll. It makes the map even better and more various by having different patterns rather than repeating the same patterns.  

The map is great, but you know what's even better? Hitsounding. On kiai section, the mapper tries to express every "wub" sound that is not monotonous yet various and complex. By giving each of them proper hitsounding feedback which reminds of [Skystar's](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/873961) [dreamless wanderer](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/286414#osu/646609) beatmap. And since it takes a lot of effort and time to find proper hitsound files and control them, it is enough for them to be a reason that makes the mapper deserve the cake. For no-kiai sections, the map consists of keysounding which is much different than nowadays keysounding in which every keysound file has longer echo than others, and to consider the song does it too it means the mapper tried to do something more than just keysounds which already take a lot of effort, but even tried to adjust or did more searching in order to find more proper keysound files to follow the song more effectively.

I would also like to mention [\_MiaoFUuU\_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4299356)'s Insane difficulty too since it's also really great. Despite having a low star rating, the map became something special than other insane difficulties. First, the map tries to express every sound and instrument feedbacks the song does provide what breaks the prejudice that you cannot make low star rating insane difficulties without ignoring some of the sounds. 
During the kiai the mapper tries to express every sound by 1/4 roll sliders to express the 1/16 sounds and keep playability at the same time. Sometimes, the map has kicksliders with New Combos in order to emphasize the dominant and strong instrument sound. Various and frequent Slider Velocity controls (1.25x -> 1.5x -> 1.25x alternation or kiai section) that the map shows also indicates that the mapper spent a lot of effort figuring out the proper and pleasing patterns. 

Overall the map is great! amount of texts I wrote down proves it lol. Try it out! It will never disappoint you, yet will make you feel amazed.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-05-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/osu/cross.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/922249)

[Down](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4694602) is back to the ranked section! On Cross Over, by HyuN feat. LyuU Down does an amazing job with featuring [Dailycare](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1634445)'s difficulty. 

Down puts a lot of interesting and cool visual works on his top difficulty. For example, when the vocal goes intense, he increases the Slider Velocity to emphasize them yet he keeps the visual consistency by making the sliders' paths consistent at some point, which is very pleasant and cool to look at. The diff does a great job with their SV controls too! For instance, when 1/3 circle+slider appears, the mapper used lower slider velocity in the progress of time in order to express the fade out sound efficiently and it did. Also, when the song goes complex, calm, and intense sections interact, the mapper uses complex and alternating SV controls in order to express some of the instrument sounds yet not prioritizing the weak sound which is really fun to play. 

The map tries a lot of gimmick stuff when the overall patterns are forced into a specific and unique style that is very notable, which is quite interesting. Make sure to check out Dailycare's GD as well! It is also awesome! : )

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-05-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/osu/kokoro.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1020878)

[toybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2848604) brings a very nice map with a nostalgic and god-tier song called Kokoro Odoru by nobodyknows+ to the ranked section! 

Top difficulty mostly keeps very structured, yet unusual and unknown patterning and mapping concept, mostly non-stacked yet spaced very closely which gives different and new gameplay experience. There are visually very similar patterns that share the same structure yet moved a bit with previous patterns dominantly which also gives a sort of consistency, and this shows its value when it's mixed with the map's own strong character and concept. 

[bbj0920](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/87546)'s Expert difficulty is also a beatmap that definitely deserves a cake. It features very varied and diverse spacing controls that follow the song's overall mood in the progress of time. It uses a lot of unusual rhythm on it, for example, there are some of blank rhythms or mixing the variety of rhythm by sometimes leaving white tick for sliderends which is really unusual and not frequently used technique, yet it did a great job. With all of these and some of the other gimmicks that the map consists of, it perfectly succeeds to follow the song properly and perfectly catching almost every various sounds that the song provides. Try this mapset out! No difficulty on it will disappoint you and will even make you dance, as the top difficulty's name does!

Taking the first place in the Autumn Spotlights is Dustvoxx, Laur - FireLight, a tribecore track that will absolutely not surprise those familiar with previous works from [yea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6874332). Boasting a marathon length of 5 minutes and 39 seconds, the map does not become boring at any given second, as the steady pacing of the song mixed with its classic buildups and choruses will certainly keep you on your toes. 

It would be highly inappropriate to not mention how the slider velocity manipulation has accompanied the patterning, providing a perfect topping to an already delicious cake. The small changes in the music intensity have been perfectly recreated with their respective slider velocity changes. Finally, it is of utmost importance to give credit to the wavy slider velocity section in the tribal-esque music section, which not only is a sight to behold, but also a reading challenge for an otherwise simple melodic section. 

All in all, yea has managed to give birth to a worthy successor to the other Spotlight victor "Sound Chimera" and to a thrilling masterpiece deserving of its top spot in the Autumn Spotlights.

In 2nd place we have Frums - theyaremanycolors mapped by [Genjuro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3196091), a song and map created by two very popular individuals in their respective communities. This is a very intricate and a harder-than-average GD set where each mapper shows off their own understanding of the song. 

Each difficulty contains excellent usage of slider velocity changes to give the player more depth in relation to both the map and music. Each difficulty is beautifully crafted and shows deep understanding of what proper structure in a map should be. Something this set does which not many people have done this year is make their lower difficulties enjoyable, and it's clear that all the mappers involved in this mapset have spent a lot of time and care making sure every difficulty is to the highest of standards. Breaks in every difficulty are utilised well and are executed in a way which leaves no room for boredom throughout the entire map. 

The top diff, Synthesia, has players having to hit many different snappings and watching Genjuro's favourite weapon of choice: Slider Velocity, which gives the player an immersive experience and allows them to become indulged in the music as they play this perfection of a map.

In the third place, we have Good-bye Chalon, an instrumental track by Nekomata Master where [/_DUSK/_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6092181) perfectly managed to capture the rustic feeling of the music.

As the song itself is fairly complex, the Inner Oni difficulty features a lot of patterns on irregular snaps while maintaining impeccable flow, which results in a very satisfying gameplay experience as it provides players with a nice accuracy challenge while flawlessly following the music. Apart from the patterns themselves, the SV usage does a very good job at representing the intensity of each section which makes this a great map in terms of visual responsiveness.

The Oni difficulty gives intermediate players a chance to shine as it is structured in a way that it doesn't become too complex for the target audience while still being extremely fun to play!

The obligatory metal beatmap for the Autumn spotlights is Inferi - A Betrayal Unforetold, a Featured Artist song mapped by [Raiden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2239480) and [Grünschale/Greenshell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Greenshell) (with a storyboard by [Faputa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Faputa)!.

This intense song is filled with insane guitars and drums, which reflect in the Perfidiae difficulty. It's out to drain all of your stamina with its numerous never-ending 'deathstreams', complicated long streams that in this map also often include a staple for modern metal maps, mono streams. You will understand when you play the map, trust me. These streams are very well mapped, with the two mappers' styles not conflicting once in the map, rather complimenting each other, with several ideas shared between their sections making this map also feel more coherent.

Along with some inoffensive slider velocity changes the mappers managed to make a really good map to a quite difficult-to-map song, a feat that deserves a spot in this season's spotlights.

In 5th place we have Silentroom x Tanchiky - Outer Solution, which is an approach to MEGALOVANIA from the UNDERTALE series, one of the most popular games this year.

About the mapping, there's just so much to say about it that we could keep talking about it for hours: Even though [rubies87](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4949934) is a rather new mapper with this being his first apparition in the ranked section, it truly shines as one of the best creations that not even the most experienced mappers can possibly do.

With an incredible judgment of the tools the song provided him to make an excellent approach that could at first look incoherent to the song but ends up adding a layer to it that makes it much more rich and an adequate usage of SV that is perfectly readable on a first try, makes this map not only spotlight worthy but also a good reason to believe how promising rubies87 is as a mapper.

Closing this season (and year) spotlights we have Camellia - We Could Get More Machinegun Psystyle! (And More Genre Switches) mapped by [Alchyr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4993032), a popular individual who has created by far one of the most unique speed maps of the year. Both the song and map are insane, showcasing a wide variety of snappings and BPM changes, making this quite the challenge to get good accuracy on, not to mention the fact that the player must also keep up with the speed of all the notes at the same time. 

Slider Velocity is seamlessly integrated into the map, especially in the variable BPM sections to compliment the frequent intensity changes of the music which gives an incredible amount of depth to the map. The map contains a hefty share of technical and stream sections which leaves no room for the player to rest for the entirety of it. If there’s one person who knows how to map a speedy Camellia song properly, it’s this guy.

Many mappers may assume that it's hard to be creative on calm and slow songs, but [-Ken](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4430811) proves that slow maps can also be mapped with creativity. Though it's -Ken's first ranked map, the map itself is really clean and full of amazing patterns. 

Especially for the kiai parts, the mapper uses a lot of high velocity sliders, which is not common in slow maps, but these sliders fit the map pretty well and give the player a pretty deep impact on this unique mapping style. The flows are carefully arranged and good for all players. Even with the hyper sliders, it's not hard for new players to catch. Spare some time and casually enjoy this masterpiece!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-05-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/catch/trappola.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/994994)

[Du5t](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6053071) just snatched the second place in this season's osu!catch Spotlights with his take on gmnt's "trappola bewitching"!

The top difficulty, named Necromancy, features intense jumps during the kiai sections, wild build-ups but calm intro and mid sections. Do not be fooled by the easy start, this map becomes challenging as soon as the melody picks up. The rhythm is easy to follow simply because Du5t decided to not vary the notes but instead do that with the patterns meanwhile trying to keep the distances as similar as possible, this was a very good decision. Due to this, it provides and easy ground to those who are skilled enough to earn an easy full combo by simply banging their head. This difficulty is a great example of how to make something good by holding back the Hyperdashes and just follow what is there.

But do not forget the guest mappers either, [Daletto](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7592136), [Greaper](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2369776), [Nuvolina](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10974170) and [Sanyi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7496029) also contributed into this set, Each of these guys approached the Gothic Hardtrapcore genre differently so be sure to take a look at their part too. Who knows, you might fall in love with this set just as much as I did!

Team osu!catch is here to take a place in this season's Spotlights with not one, nor two, but thirteen mappers!

Dreamland, which is the top difficulty, is mapped by [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) and [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598) in collab. Everyone is surely already familiar with them and probably know that they are here for a rare treat. Without even looking at who mapped which part it is easy to recognize their style although they are blending into each other in a godly manner. From the calm mid-section through the build-ups and intense intro to the kiais, this map is perfectly orchestrated and delivers what you expect from both of the mappers.

Next up we have [Minato Yukina](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/531253), [Rocma](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/566276) and a collab between [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) and [alienflybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114). They each offer a different approach on the same difficulty level which is on par, if not better, with the top difficulty. Minato Yukina decided to follow the melody which resulted in a streamy map with intense hyperjump sections, Rocma stands in the middle in terms of rhythm but he has wild patterns. Lastly, do not be fooled with the lower star rating for the collab, this is a real beast on its own, be prepared.

Going further down the list comes [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508), [Benita](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4023183) and yet another collab but now between [Sorcerer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1913190) and [Bunnrei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284). These guys took on the challenge and tried to approach the Rain difficulty differently, from low circle size to mostly 1/4 patterns. Do not be afraid if you can't handle one of these, try the others as well!

But let's not forget the rest of the team either. We still have a lot to speak of. The mapset features two Platter difficulty by [ZiRoX](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/200768) and a collab between [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) and [Mbomb](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3071175) each with their own mapping style fitting this difficulty. Then we have [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134) and [Sanyi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7496029) with a Salad and Cup respectively. These guys really went out and made this mapset fitting for everyone.

But we still have two more names to mention who took part in this, [/-Tochi](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3664366) created a wonderful storyboard and that is accompanied by wonderful hitsounds by [/-Luminate](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4778689). Together they created something really awesome. Congratulations guys!

Kill the beat by [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508) is another exciting electric song that hit the ranked category. The map consistently requires quick movements. In addition, the long sliders during the kiai of each difficulty require accurate rhythmic jumps, letting players truly catch (to) the beat. If you do like electronic music and are up for a challenge, do give this a try.

It is quite refreshing to have a K-pop in the ranked category. [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134)’s ranked map features an upbeat Korean song. The map is filled with interesting patterns across multiple difficulties that feel rewarding to play because of appropriately distanced jumps and little bits of antiflow that spices the map up, setting it apart from many others that may feel too standardized. Do please try this mapset, you won’t regret it!

[Bunnrei](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/829284) jumps into this season's Spotlights with his mapset on siromaru + cranky's "conflict". This set has no kiai but that doesn't make it easier does it? If anything, it makes more interesting!

The Overdose features 1/4 jumps in quick succession as well as pattern repetition which does add to the difficulty. If you are looking for something which does not joke around the patterns and keeps them as consistent as possible, look no further, you just found it. Alongside this, we have high slider velocity which makes some patterns very interesting and provides yet another nice challenge.

To those who likes faster challenge there is yet another Overdose called "Conquest of the Damned". Do not be fooled with the lower star rating, this can provide the same, if not more, challenge then the other difficulty. Then lastly we have the lower difficulties to the player from every skill level. Rain with its much calmer approach of patterns even though it does feature the same 1/4 rhythm. Platter with its lowered rhythm and even easier patterns making it perfect to the player of this difficulty level. And then we have Salad and Cup for those who just want to enjoy some dope cranky in this game mode. 

Be sure to tune in even if this is not your prefered game mode, this is a real treat!

Finally we have the calling map in the ranked section. Calling has been expected for ranked for 2 years and [alienflybot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114) is always pushing it better and better. Despite the amazing aesthetic flows and streams, this map also has the epic hitsounds like other maps by the mapper himself. While enjoying the top difficulty, you may also try out other difficulties since the whole set is well done.

[Crowley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6341006) is definitely an underrated catch mapper. He mapped western songs a lot, and each map created a unique feeling. Getaway is no doubt the same. With cs5 and ar8.4 map setting, the map feels pretty casual and comfortable, but much different from others. As one of the maps in osu!catch Carpool Tunnel Mini-pack, it is a good featured artist map for middle and top players. Take care of your accuracy as this map has many droplets throughout sliders.

Though we haven't seen their face in the ranked section for quite some time now, [Parachor](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5241655) makes a strong, welcoming return back with XYZ which is arguably his most eloquent set to date along with PotassiumF, featuring the track itself which alone is absolutely wonderful to listen and as well play to. As well as the map, executing concepts like pitch relevancy, LN orientated, and with SVs as well, which you'll find to all work excellently with the song as well. 

If you've been in the mania community long enough, you might be aware of how Parachor loves to experiment with many of his maps with different uses of SVs, adding this incredible distinction from other mappers in the ranked section as he very well knows how to execute them astonishingly well to whatever song he finds to work well with them. This map isn't an exception to this as he perfectly knows the importance of timing and the beautiful things you can make with them and he makes it very clear to why they can be such an important structure in a map. Although it's on the low side in terms of star rating, don't let PotassiumF's normal difficulty deceive you as it's not your ordinary normal difficulty as it features tricky LN pattering and SVs as well, making his first introductory guest difficulty to the ranked section all in all a blast to play. 

The set is gorgeous, well-thought out, and tricky to play as well, even for some of the top players of mania too. If you're looking for a challenge than your regular, average mania map, this map might just do it for you.

[BringoBrango](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10274043) jumps straight into the ranked section with this fantastic set, Bug Thief, alongside a guest difficulty by [Toaph Daddy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7616811). Both of them showcase their individual, unique approaches in the top two difficulties, both praised for their articulate layering and patterning abilities demonstrated in this set. 

This set leads us to anticipate what both of these mappers may bring to the table in the future, especially from BringoBrango, who had gone somewhat unnoticed in the unranked section before this set was ranked. This map for certain deserves its spot in the spotlights, and we hope to see more from BringoBrango and Toaph Daddy in the future!

Combining gorgeous aesthetics and a solid overall structure, [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576)'s crystallized is a treat for any long note enthusiast. The map juxtaposes lighter layered sections focused on strict layering for maximum emphasis alongside denser long note sections focused on following the more intense section's stronger synths and percussion while keeping representation understandable and consistent overall.

Despite the contrast between sections, -mint- does an impressive job at keeping coherent concepts consistent through the entire map, such as chord allocation and pitch relevancy. Her emphasis on using long note lengths to represent instrument type and intensity as well as her ability to differentiate regular and long notes depending on the instruments used and the intensity of the song is very impressive and shows her prowess in making long note maps. Overall the map is an absolute joy to play and the fantastic concepts used make it more than worthy of a place in Spotlights!

[Kamuy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7439226) successfully managed to capture the harsh and repetitive nature of the song (that is, PSYQUI's Education) and transform it into a tough map that is not for the fainted heart! The chart cleverly exploits minijacks and short LNs to artificially induce the feeling of roughness and make the map harder to nail off, especially for players with bad endurance.

Kamuy's implementation of the map's repetition also does justice to the song without actually making the map feel repetitive, using variations of structuring throughout the entire map. In general, the map is a blast to play to and as a medium to enjoy the song. If you are not up for the challenge though, ByeForNow's difficulty and all of the easier difficulties still follow the same ideologies while sparing you a fight.

A metronome will not help you at all.

After four years ([Jakads](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/259972)'s old mapset of the song was submitted in August 2015), Konran Shoujo Soflan-chan makes it into the ranked section. With frequent BPM changes, the map keeps the player on their toes at all times. Though denpa is not for everyone, the map's unique patterning and concepts, especially with its LN usage and polyrhythms, makes for a wild and fun ride. Enjoyable overall, whether it be because of or in spite of its chaotic nature, this map deserves its place in this season's Spotlights.

Who would've pictured to see this map ranked? [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092), along with a 4K guest difficulty from [\-mint\-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576), presents an excruciatingly difficult mapset - Frums's Pictured as Perfect and Plus. The map simply packs in everything in the 5:44 masterpiece. 

Blocko's 7K difficulty is replete with relentless patterning that coordinates the chaotic nature of the song to its fullest. The marathon hardly provides any breaks, so the HP Drain suddenly adds into the chaos that the map is already in, not to mention the little touches of SV throughout the map. You will need to tighten your seatbelt as you fall into this dream.

-mint-'s 4K difficulty offers a similar taste to the 7K difficulty. Her difficulty packs in abrasive technical patterns that require high control and composure. Despite the chaos, the map maintains a consistent structure. In the midst of all the mayhem, will you be able to break out of the daze?

Even though this is [Cokiiplay](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6760124)'s first bout in the ranked section, he is by no means a new face to the charting scene. He makes this abundantly clear in this chart for Knife that utilizes a fitting technical and meticulous approach. Within it are many elements that show off his charting experience such as deliberate placements of jumps, use of pitch relevance where applicable, and a clear level of repetition that fit extraordinarily well to both the song and the technical approach that was used.

If that wasn't enough, there is also another layer to the meticulous charting scheme that Knife brings to the table, and that comes in how it is experienced while playing. Cokiiplay does a phenomenal job of combining his prowess with intuitive pattern motion that makes it feel like the player is actually making the drum and breakcore sounds in the song. Because of this, the playing experience is made to be extremely satisfying, an element that is very easy to miss when charting. The clear display of deliberate pattern choices with a playing experience that is arguably even better carves Knife a very deserving spot in spotlights!
