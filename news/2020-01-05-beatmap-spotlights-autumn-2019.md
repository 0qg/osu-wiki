[Beomsan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3626063) and [Down](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4694602) here to show how detailed a map could be. In their mapset of Nekomata Master+’s “POINT ZERO”, every pitch change and variation in intensity is perfectly represented, with the constant changes in spacing and the high contrast between slider velocities. But that’s just the beginning.

To accompany the spontaneous piano and the jumbled background percussions near the end, the map strives to portray every bit of the music. Irregular patterns kick in, increasing the intensity of the beatmap to match the music. Such a chaotic piece being depicted in such a chaotic fashion, it’s without question that this should be added to your collection.

Being a fanatic of Nekomata Master’s music tracks, [Icekalt](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5410645) decided to compile some of their best in Instrumental Compilation. He portrays every track excerpt as thoroughly as possible, putting in 1/6 trills, long chains of low bpm streams, varying slider velocity constantly, keeping the map very engaging.

On top of this, he also invited mappers [ScubDomino](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8972308), [den0saur](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5385151), [Xilver15](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3099689) and [celerih](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4696296) to map a few of the songs as well, with each of their own unique styles to represent their respective songs.

A wild [pishifat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3178418) appeared on Spotlight!

Shadowmaker, made by pishifat, would be able to described into one sentense; it shows how various / diverse a map can be. each notable sections are represented very well and all of they have their own strong characteristic and gimmick. For example, for section where the guitar goes really intense and climax, the map does it too. It goes the most intense than any sections the map had and they spectacularly succeed to represent the song. 

Not only those efforts to try to show various styles, but also it overall is based on a certain strong style so that patterns do not go weird when connected sequentially. For example, the map consists of really consistent structure from each sections  and it helps to make each patterns sometimes homogeneous but sometimes creative too. and "that style" also just goes its own way when we are recently full of newer / different than previous styles which is appreciable!

To mention the other gimmick / interesting thing the map has, it is impossible not to mention the slider's velocity changes. as you can see in editor, you will see a lot of green line (inherent timing points) and most of them are mainly for slider velocity's changes!  By this I mean that the mapper tried a lot of Slider Velocity combinations through numerous trial and errors to find the optimal ones, which takes a lot of effort and cute too! Especially at the build up part before alternator style section, you will see that the speed changes are fluctuating really frequently that sometimes it drops from 4.00x to 1.50x. And they are very nice and interesting decision in terms of that these pattern try to capture literally every features from the song. For example, the map uses really high SV when factors such as guitar, snare sound, and etc are mixed whereas when the beat has monotonous participants it only provides slow SV which is really representing the song well! To consider all of those, there's absolutely no way that this map will fail to amaze you.

[Down](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4694602) is back to the ranked section! on Cross Over, by HyuN feat. LyuU. Down does an amazing job with featuring [Dailycare](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1634445)'s difficulty. 

Down puts a lot of interesting and cool visual works on his top difficulty. For example, when the vocal goes intense, he increases the slider's velocity to emphasize them yet he keep the visual consistent by making the sliders' path consistent at some point which is very pleasant and cool to look at. The diff does great job with their SV controls too! for instance, when 1/3 circle+slider appears, the mapper used lower slider velocity in progress of time in order to express the fade out sound efficiently and it did. also, where the song goes complex and calm and intense sections interact, mapper tries to use complex yet alternating SV controls in order to express some of instrument sounds yet not prioritizing the weak sound which is really fun to play. 

The map tries a lot of gimmick stuff when the overall patterns are forced into a specific and unique style that is very notable, which is quite interesting. Make sure to check out Dailycare's GD as well too! It is also awesome! : )

Taking the first place in the Autumn Spotlights is Dustvoxx, Laur - FireLight, a tribecore track that will absolutely not surprise those familiar with previous works from [yea](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6874332). Boasting a marathon length of 5 minutes and 39 seconds, the map does not become boring at any given second, as the steady pacing of the song mixed with its classic buildups and choruses will certainly keep you on your toes. 

It would be highly inappropriate to not mention how the slider velocity manipulation has accompanied the patterning, providing a perfect topping to an already delicious cake. The small changes in the music intensity have been perfectly recreated with their respective slider velocity changes. Finally, it is of utmost importance to give credit to the wavy slider velocity section in the tribal-esque music section, which not only is a sight to behold, but also a reading challenge for an otherwise simple melodic section. 

All in all, yea has managed to give birth to a worthy successor to the other Spotlight victor "Sound Chimera" and to a thrilling masterpiece deserving of its top spot in the Autumn Spotlights.

In 2nd place we have Frums - theyaremanycolors mapped by [Genjuro](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3196091), a song and map created by two very popular individuals in their respective communities. This is a very intricate and a harder-than-average GD set where each mapper shows off their own understanding of the song. 

Each difficulty contains excellent usage of slider velocity changes to give the player more depth in relation to both the map and music. Each difficulty is beautifully crafted and shows deep understanding of what proper structure in a map should be. Something this set does which not many people have done this year is make their lower difficulties enjoyable, and it's clear that all the mappers involved in this mapset have spent a lot of time and care making sure every difficulty is to the highest of standards. Breaks in every difficulty are utilised well and are executed in a way which leaves no room for boredom throughout the entire map. 

The top diff, Synthesia, has players having to hit many different snappings and watching Genjuro's favourite weapon of choice: Slider Velocity, which gives the player an immersive experience and allows them to become indulged in the music as they play this perfection of a map.

In the third place we have Good-bye Chalon, an instrumental track by Nekomata Master where [/_DUSK/_](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6092181) perfectly managed to capture the rustic feeling of the music.

As the song itself is fairly complex, the Inner Oni difficulty features a lot of patterns on irregular snaps while maintaining impeccable flow, which results in a very satisfying gameplay experience as it provides players with a nice accuracy challenge while flawlessly following the music. Apart from the patterns themselves, the SV usage does a very good job at representing the intensity of each section which makes this a great map in terms of visual responsiveness.

The Oni difficulty gives intermediate players a chance to shine as it is structured in a way that it doesn't become too complex for the target audience while still being extremely fun to play!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-05-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/taiko/betrayal.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1026679)

The obligatory metal beatmap for the Autumn spotlights is Inferi - A Betrayal Unforetold, a Featured Artist song mapped by [Raiden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2239480) and [Grünschale/Greenshell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Greenshell) (with a storyboard by [Faputa](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/Faputa)!.

This intense song is filled with insane guitars and drums, which reflect in the Perfidiae difficulty. It's out to drain all of your stamina with its numerous never-ending 'deathstreams', complicated long streams that in this map also often include a staple for modern metal maps, mono streams. You will understand when you play the map, trust me. These streams are very well mapped, with the two mappers' styles not conflicting once in the map, rather complimenting each other, with several ideas shared between their sections making this map also feel more coherent.

Along with some inoffensive slider velocity changes the mappers managed to make a really good map to a quite difficult-to-map song, a feat that deserves a spot in this season's spotlights.

In 5th place we have Silentroom x Tanchiky - Outer Solution, which is an approach to MEGALOVANIA from the UNDERTALE series, one of the most popular games this year.

About the mapping, there's just so much to say about it that we could keep talking about it for hours: Even though [rubies87](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4949934) is a rather new mapper with this being his first apparition in the ranked section, it truly shines as one of the best creations that not even the most experienced mappers can possibly do.

With an incredible judgment of the tools the song provided him to make an excellent approach that could at first look incoherent to the song but ends up adding a layer to it that makes it much more rich and an adequate usage of SV that is perfectly readable on a first try, makes this map not only spotlight worthy but also a good reason to believe how promising rubies87 is as a mapper.

Closing this season (and year) spotlights we have Camellia - We Could Get More Machinegun Psystyle! (And More Genre Switches) mapped by [Alchyr](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4993032), a popular individual who has created by far one of the most unique speed maps of the year. Both the song and map are insane, showcasing a wide variety of snappings and BPM changes, making this quite the challenge to get good accuracy on, not to mention the fact that the player must also keep up with the speed of all the notes at the same time. 

Slider Velocity is seamlessly integrated into the map, especially in the variable BPM sections to compliment the frequent intensity changes of the music which gives an incredible amount of depth to the map. The map contains a hefty share of technical and stream sections which leaves no room for the player to rest for the entirety of it. If there’s one person who knows how to map a speedy Camellia song properly, it’s this guy.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-01-05-beatmap-spotlights-autumn-2019/catch/cold.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/946446)

Many mappers may assume that it's hard to be creative on calm and slow songs, but [-Ken](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4430811) proves that slow maps can also be mapped with creativity. Though it's -Ken's first ranked map, the map itself is really clean and full of amazing patterns. 

Especially for the kiai parts, the mapper uses a lot of high velocity sliders, which is not common in slow maps, but these sliders fits the map pretty well and gives players a pretty deep impact on this unique mapping style. The flows are carefully arranged and good for all players. Even with the hyper sliders, it's not hard for new players to catch. Spare some time and casually enjoy this masterpiece!

[Crowley](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6341006) is definitely an underrated catch mapper. He mapped western songs a lot, and each map created an unique feeling. Getaway is no doubt the same. With cs5 and ar8.4 map setting, the map feels pretty casual and comfortable, but much different from other maps. As one of the maps in osu!catch Carpool Tunnel Mini-pack, it is a good featured artist map for middle and top players. Take care of your accuracy as this map has many droplets throughout sliders.

Combining gorgeous aesthetics and a solid overall structure, [-mint-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576)'s crystallized is a treat for any long note enthusiast. The map juxtaposes lighter layered sections focused on strict layering for maximum emphasis alongside denser long note sections focused on following the more intense section's stronger synths and percussion while keeping representation understandable and consistent overall.

Despite the contrast between sections, -mint- does an impressive job at keeping coherent concepts consistent through the entire map, such as chord allocation and pitch relevancy. Her emphasis on using long note lengths to represent instrument type and intensity as well as her ability to differentiate regular and long notes depending on the instruments used and the intensity of the song is very impressive and shows her prowess in making long note maps. Overall the map is an absolute joy to play and the fantastic concepts used make it more than worthy of a place in Spotlights!

[Kamuy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7439226) successfully managed to capture the harsh and repetitive nature of the song (that is, PSYQUI's Education) and transform it into a tough map that is not for the fainted heart! The chart cleverly exploits minijacks and short LNs to artificially induce the feeling of roughness and make the map harder to nail off, especially for players with bad endurance.

Kamuy's implementation of the map's repetition also does justice to the song without actually making the map feel repetitive, using variations of structuring throughout the entire map. In general, the map is a blast to play to and as a medium to enjoy the song. If you are not up for the challenge though, ByeForNow's difficulty and all of the easier difficulties still follow the same ideologies while sparing you a fight.

Who would've pictured to see this map ranked? [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092), along with a 4K guest difficulty from [\-mint\-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8976576), presents an excruciatingly difficult mapset - Frums's Pictured as Perfect and Plus. The map simply packs in everything in the 5:44 masterpiece. 

Blocko's 7K difficulty is replete with relentless patterning that coordinates the chaotic nature of the song to its fullest. The marathon hardly provides any breaks, so the HP Drain suddenly adds into the chaos that the map is already in, not to mention the little touches of SV throughout the map. You will need to tighten your seatbelt as you fall into this dream.

-mint-'s 4K difficulty offers a similar taste to the 7K difficulty. Her difficulty packs in abrasive technical patterns that require high control and composure. Despite the chaos, the map maintains a consistent structure. In the midst of all the mayhem, will you be able to break out of the daze?

Even though this is [Cokiiplay](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6760124)'s first bout in the ranked section, he is by no means a new face to the charting scene. He makes this abundantly clear in this chart for Knife that utilizes a fitting technical and meticulous approach. Within it are many elements that show off his charting experience such as deliberate placements of jumps, use of pitch relevance where applicable, and a clear level of repetition that fit extraordinarily well to both the song and the technical approach that was used.

If that wasn't enough, there is also another layer to the meticulous charting scheme that Knife brings to the table, and that comes in how it is experienced while playing. Cokiiplay does a phenomenal job of combining his prowess with intuitive pattern motion that makes it feel like the player is actually making the drum and breakcore sounds in the song. Because of this, the playing experience is made to be extremely satisfying, an element that is very easy to miss when charting. The clear display of deliberate pattern choices with a playing experience that is arguably even better carves Knife a very deserving spot in spotlights!
