The drums of war fade, and in the lingering silence, we find our winner. Triumphant among the twelve, one stands supreme in osu!taiko's first official contest of creative wills. Read on to find out more!

Over thirty intrepid souls stepped forward to pit their osu!taiko mapping skills against [Function Phantom](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/14)'s Algebra.

Showcased live to an audience of stunned viewers, twelve were chosen for the community's vote, the ravenous vultures of creative expectation looming high in the skies above.

And judge they did.

Beloved by judge and community both, the winner of Aspire 2017: Stage Two is none other than **Intense Muskrat**, mapped by the extraordinarily talented [Supairo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2837231), with a total score of **72.3/80** and **180** unique votes.

A superb display of mechanical prowess and storyboarding expertise, Supairo's hallmark entry scraped a solid lead in both the judging and community vote scoring categories. It's no surprise as to why.

Here's what our judges had to say:

Gruellingly close but ever so far, **Powerful Viper** by [tasuke912](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2774767) was nipping at the winning entry's heels every step of the way, scoring **67.2/80** with **162** unique votes.

Featuring a combination dual-lane + multi-mod gimmick polished to near perfection, tasuke912's entry was a frontrunner from the very beginning. Falling short from victory in the judging panel by less than a point and only 18 unique votes overall, it honestly surprises nobody that the contest was almost too close to call.

Here's what the judges thought:

Trailing behind the two frontrunners in third place overall was **Jovial Lark** by the much-loved [S a n d](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/676578), scoring **56.1/80** with **128** unique votes overall.

Featuring the most literal interpretation of algebra seen in the contest period, S a n d's storyboarded masterpiece combined complex visual cues nearly wrapped up in nearly indecipherable algebraic formulae, masterfully weaving clever obscuring techniques to support the breadth of his design overall.

Here's what our judges thought:

Thank you to everybody who took the time to make entries and send them in, and also to everybody who set time aside to join us for the livestream feature - we peaked nearly 500 viewers, a feat that has historically only been reserved for the crowning events of the osu!taiko community (such as TWC grand finals).

A massive thank you to our expert panel of volunteer judges (mangomizer, Unmei Muma and Nwolf), who went above and beyond in their contributions to help make everything about Aspire Stage Two reality.

For the Aspire fanatics among us, we will be announcing the commencement of Stage Three at a later date, featuring the antics of **osu!catch**'s most creative mappers for all to gawk at.

Will they go for the low-hanging fruit of cheap and flashy gimmicks, or will we see something truly extraordinary? Probably the latter, but I wanted to make an awful fruit pun, so deal with it.

See you next time!
