Having worn the purple uniform for roughly one and a half year, Unpredictable has rolled up his sleeves to partake in the evaluation of the fellow nominators. "Too soon!" you might think?

## Mappers' Showcase

Into the next round of the Mappers’ Showcase we go! This time featuring two amazing hidden gems from the osu!catch game mode. A lot of thanks to this month's contributors [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134) and [alienfanboy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/636114).

### Verti

[Verti](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10674528) is an ambitious newcomer to the osu!catch mapping scene. His mapping prowess should not be underestimated as he managed to push three maps to the ranked section within three months, achieving the impossible as deemed by most novice mappers.

His debut is [nonoc – Memento (TV Size)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1417543#fruits/2920895), a Cup to Rain spread mapped solely by himself, which the ranking process only lasted for a month. He has been gaining recognition from the osu!catch community with his 4-minute Platter to Overdose spread [Amatsuki – DORAEMON]( https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1327531#fruits/2750179) starred in CWC2021 as a Finals DT pick.

He may be keen on producing maps for Japanese vocals, yet he is currently opening up new vista on trance and rhythm game music such as [xi – Ascension to Heaven]( https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1482069#fruits/3060297), a collaboration project with his mapping mentor, as well as [Morimori Atsushi vs. uma – Noel (long ver.)]( https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1483009#fruits/3041759), a clean Overdose marathon featuring intense streams, consistent patterns and on-point hitsounds. Verti has certainly set a prime example to fellow newcomers that self-motivation can bring you more than expected.

### KuroRev

A veteran mapper who's been crafting maps for 5 years now, [KuroRev](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6581584) is a virtuoso when it comes to intuitive flow, delivering natural gameplay and bestowing great satisfaction to players. Given his vast experience, it is no question that he certainly knows what he’s doing in the editor. 

Recently breaching through the ranked section, he finally propels with his rendition of [Asriel - Kegare Naki Yume](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/710899#fruits/1502772) which features a simple yet captivating style with its pleasing aesthetic and coherent representation to the music. A similar fashion to this would be his take on [sokoninaru - Tenohira de odoru](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1200657#fruits/2500410) presenting clean-looking streams and apt spacing usage to emphasize the music accordingly.

Other than being a hard rock mapper himself, KuroRev has also been endeavouring to push his first full solo set with the lovely future bass song [YUC’e - Cinderella Syndrome](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1467712#fruits/3013948), showcasing his mastery on movement and immaculate pattern structure. If you do like his maps, consider clicking that bell on his profile to not miss out on his later bangers. We are eager to see his motivation grow further and hopefully he creates more interesting maps!

## Mapping Contests

Another month of community hosted contests is upon us, this time with something sweet for all taiko and catch mapper with some really great prizes. You don’t know how to map taiko or catch? That doesn’t matter, you should try your luck anyways! Who knows, maybe there’s some hidden master mapper within you.

### osu!flushed Taiko Mapping Contest

The [osu!flushed Taiko Mapping Contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1342681) is a brand new contest where choosing the songs falls onto your hands. That's right, you will have an *almost* complete freedom in the song choices, and the only restriction is that the song needs to follow a certain theme.

As for the prizes, the winner gets a 6 months of osu!supporter tag, while the runners-up receive a 4 months of osu!supporter tag as the 2nd or 3rd place.

Don't wait for the drums to roll! Go ahead and sign yourself up via the thread above to show who places the blues and reds the best!

### osu!catch 2021 Summer Featured Artist Cup

As the summer cracks the door open, the fruits start ripening. To fill your cup with the bestest of them, join the [osu!catch Featured Artist Cup](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1327798) right away!

Featuring the songs from the [Featured Artists](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) joined the lineup between March 20th - June 20th, the contest will test your mapping capabilities in two difficulties: one being Platter or lower, and the other being Rain or higher.

But that's not all. This one has some prizes too! The winner will be rewarded with 100 USD in cash and having the set modded by the host and the judges! Should you not make it to the top, the runners-up will still get a reward. 20 USD in cash in addition to 4 months osu!supporter will be granted for the 2nd place, and the 3rd place will enjoy the 2 months of osu!supporter.

Well, how does it sound? Have we got you interested in getting your hands dirty with the fruit juice? Then be quick, the sign-ups closing soon on the **20th June**!

### osu!catch Mapping World Cup 2021

Another contest that is going to fill your fruit bowl has been brought up to light, and this time a country-based one! Brought to you by the osu!catch mapping grand-master [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) for the third time, the [osu!catch Mapping World Cup 2021](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1350409) will have the bestest mappers from all over the globe gather around and have an intense competition that will determine the next osu!catch Mapping Champions!

Needless to say that such a contest isn't going to be left without prizes, but all the details for that matter are currently work-in-progress. To keep track of the updates and learn more about the contest, we highly suggest you to check the aforementioned forum thread, and dive right into the [o!CMWC Discord server](https://discord.gg/eTUFAjf "Discord") prepared with love for this very contest!

Alright catch folks! Hopefully, we've made your day with these two majestic contests, but be warned that they may over the dose of your daily fruit intake. Proceed with caution!

## Around the Community

The community has worked hard this month to present you with a variety of activities that happened in the past month. Got you interested? Awesome! Then continue reading to find out more.

### Guide to making your first osu!mania 10K beatmap

Not so long ago, osu!mania got a new key-mode. After a long wait, 10K beatmaps can finally be ranked. And that's exactly what they need now. But how to start and how to map 10K? The same question came up on the 10K+ Rhythm Game Community server and so they gathered and created their own guide!

The 10K community representative [\[Sick\]Catcat](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11544934) has posted their [10K osu!mania Mapping Guide](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1336072) in the osu!mania sub forum with everything you need to know about mapping 10K osu!mania. From how to start, various pattern structures to useful tips and tricks from Easy to Hard difficulties.

Got you interested? That's great! Then get your favourite song and start mapping. 10K osu!mania is in urgent need of more ranked beatmaps. And should you need more help, the [10K+ Rhythm Game Community](https://discord.gg/PwzcUzk) would be more than happy to help you out further with your map!

### osu! Featured Artist Compilation Blind Beatmap Collab

Now, let's take a moment for ourselves and admire the wonderful collaborative effort the community has put forward, because [**this is where we are, and what unites us**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1483077#osu/3041896).

Hosted by the talented mapper and modder [Nuvolina](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10974170), the blind collab project features an hour-long medley composed of minute sections from various Featured Artist tracks delicately compiled by [ModlesS\_Flash](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5113095).

And of course, such a massive project wouldn't have been left without a showcase stream! The vod is available below for those who have missed it or wish to fall under its spell once again:

And that’s it for this month. Good we didn’t promise anything last time because once again we are late but the IRL stress will finally be gone within the next weeks which means the next issues should be hopefully on time!

As always, should you know anything mapping or modding related, be it guides, podcasts or videos, let us know. We would love to touch upon them in the next issue of Mappers' Report!

You can either directly contact [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717) or drop by in the `#mappers-report` channel on the [osu! community Discord server](https://discord.gg/0Vxo9AsejDkGlk3H).

Hope to see you there soon. Thank you for reading, stay safe and healthy!
