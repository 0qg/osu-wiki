The drum mashing of the Taiko World Cup 2018 has concluded while the fruit puns of the osu!catch World Cup will soon commence. The journey for the gold medal has left us with one winning team, but definitely not in the dominant fashion that was expected.

**Note: Due to an unfortunate situation surrounding foul play, team United States has forfeited out of the TWC and we won't go over their matches in this recap. You can read about the situation at https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/743380

### Finals Matches

**In the first match, Canada claimed their top 4 placing by taking down South Korea 7-3.** The Koreans dominated the speedy nomod picks [Nanoka - Tsukimade Todoke, Fushi no Kemuri](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/763774#taiko/1605963) and [Lily - Scarlet Rose](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/195238#taiko/463330), but that only got them so far. Having reached the Finals as the only remaining mid-seed, this hailed the end of South Korea's spectacular run this TWC. Just imagine what they could accomplish with a bigger roster in future cups...

History was simultaneously repeated and made in the Winners Finals match between Japan vs. Taiwan in one of the most exciting matches we've seen thus far. Everyone was on the edge of their seats as the increasing chinks in Japan's armor turned into an unprecedented 3 - 3 tie halfway into the match. Japan however regained their composure and pulled ahead to end with a 7 - 3 victory. With Japan's armor not as impenetrable as we thought, we'll have to wait until the Grand Finals to see if any of the remaining teams can turn those visible chinks into a victory.

Due to the forfeit of United States, Indonesia got another chance against Canada in the match for 3rd place. Unfortunately, one of the key players from Indonesia were missing which left the rest of Team Indonesia not on par with Canada's coherence. **The Canadians swept their way into top 3 with a 7-0 sweep.**

When Canada went up against Taiwan, their memorization game was on point as they opened the match with a win on the SV map [cranky - R176](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1623411). After that, Taiwan remembered their warmup map [Dave Rodgers - Deja Vu](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1637925). **They knew it was their time to go to the grand final, which they had been in before.** In order to get there, they hit full throttle to the point where Canada could not keep up. Taiwan had secured their Grand Final spot over Canada 7-1.

As for the Grand Final, Taiwan was still going at full speed since the last match as they won the first 3 points against Japan. If that in itself isn't a historical achivement, Japan had to suffer 2 more maps lost as they clawed their way back to a 7-5 victory. Taiwan truly played their hearts out and made the Grand Final one of the most even matches of the tournament.Taiwan may have lost the match, but atleast they ended the tournament with a win on the tiebreaker showcase:

And that wraps up all the matches for this year! Here's how the entire elimination bracket went down:

### Finals Mappool

There was bound to be diversity in the picks, since teams required a whole 7 map wins in order to win in this stage. As the work for the mappool selectors this year has come to an end, here are the closing comments of one of them:

[mangomizer](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1893718):

""It may come as a surprise to you that the Finals Mappool was the second mappool we started work on, immediately following Group Stage. This was done as a precaution to avoid having a repeat of the thermal runaway mappool that almost killed everyone last year. In spite of this, the Finals Mappool still ended up being extremely difficult – perhaps even more challenging than last year. We are thankful to have started this early, as it gave us more time to ensure the balance of the mappool.

With regards to the matches last weekend, I’m certainly glad to see a fairly even spread of picks across the board. “Nanoka - Tsukimade Todoke, Fushi no Kemuri” was probably my greatest oversight – I had seriously underestimated the difficulty it would pose on the players. Otherwise, I am seriously impressed with how players are coping with this mappool – their stellar performances exceeding my expectations more times than I can count. I eagerly await for more surprises in the upcoming final weekend matches!”

### Conclusion

We saw some mid seeded teams really step up this year. Hong Kong taking Canada to tiebreaker, Spain reaching top 8 and South Korea reaching top 6 are all signs of the skill gap between teams evening out, so let's hope this trend continues in future cups!
