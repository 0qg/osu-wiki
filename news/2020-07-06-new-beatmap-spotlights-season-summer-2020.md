For the first time since our initial announcement, the Renewed Beatmap Spotlights boot off with its first Summer Season and a plethora of rewards for everybody joining the brand-new competitive, seasonal League.

Everybody in our new team of curators worked hard to bring forth the most excellent maps osu! has to offer and to present you a new competitive league to enjoy their selections. While the first ideas have been kept vague in our first announcement, here are some details on how this new system works:

- **Every weekend in this season we will be hosting a weekly timeshift lobby using a playlist created from the pool of curated beatmaps using osu!lazer.** Therefore, you have to join the timeshift lobbies on osu!lazer in order to participate in the competitive league. If you have never heard of timeshift multiplayer lobbies before, [you can learn more here](https://blog.ppy.sh/enjoying-osu-with-others/), or just [get osu!lazer yourself and try it out now](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases).
- Every Monday, the week's playlist will be unveiled on the [Beatmap Spotlights wiki page](/wiki/Beatmap_Spotlights). This means that **beatmaps being played in the Spotlights league lobbies will change every week**. For future seasons, we plan to unveil these maps in a livestream as a beatmap showcase.
- The results of the weekly timeshift lobby will be collated into a big **Seasonal Ranking**. Depending your position on the Seasonal Ranking, you can earn yourself a **unique and permanent profile badge**. The profile badges will already be awarded after the 2nd week of this season and will be updated every week, reflecting your current position in the Seasonal Ranking. Once this season ends, you will keep your profile badge forever.
- There will be **four playlists in total, each consisting of 5 beatmaps** and each being played three times during the season. This gives you plenty of opportunities to revisit your weekly scores as only your best total score on a playlist will be considered for your position on the Seasonal Ranking.
- On top of that **the Top 10 people of each timeshift lobby will be awarded with 1 week of supporter tag**.
- At the end of the season, we will **elect the best mapper of this season** and provide a **new unlockable medal** for those who want to play through the Seasonal Beatmaps once the season has concluded.

Of course each game mode will have their own leaderboard and playlists. If you are interested in the full details of this system, you can visit the [Beatmap Spotlights wiki page](/wiki/Beatmap_Spotlights) to learn more.

With that being said, the Summer 2020 season has been fully prepared and is ready for deployment. Therefore, the first timeshift lobby will open **this Friday** already. The first Playlist A can be found on the [Beatmap Spotlights wiki page](/wiki/Beatmap_Spotlights) already.
