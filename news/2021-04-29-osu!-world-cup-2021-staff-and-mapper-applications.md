Similar to last year we have multiple open positions for people to apply to. A few forms have changed, namely the Mappool Selector and the Mapper Application forms!

## osu! World Cup 2021

### Mapper for custom OWC maps

In the past year custom mapping has taken even more community tournaments by storm, and the osu! World Cup is not backing down either!

This year features a more specific application form with various slot descriptions to make it easier to apply as a mapper and get a feel for the broad skillsets a mappool needs.

Mappers can expect to be between late May and November.

[Apply here](linkhere) if you are interested in helping out!

### Commentator/Referee

Commentators and referees aim to provide a great live viewing experience.

Required availability is between October and November.

[Apply here](linkhere) if you are interested in helping out either as a referee or a commentator!
