With our latest Spotlight season released very recently, we are underway reworking osu! Spotlights from ground up, starting with a brand new team and adding a whole new league system.

Since March 2017, osu! Spotlights have worked in their current shape and form. While many mappers and players already love the idea of beatmaps being put on a pedestal, we want to expand on the idea by giving the curation and participation in osu! Spotlights a whole new twist.
While we want to keep recommending beatmaps to you, we also want to add a whole new competitive and seasonal league closely attached to the recommended beatmaps. With this, you and your friends will have even more reason to delve deep into the best creations osu! has to offer.

We are still working on the details about how this league will work, but here are some aspects we *plan* to do:

- **We want to host weekly timeshift lobbies**, using osu!lazer's recently implemented feature, by having people compete actively on a portion of the beatmaps we have selected for the Spotlights.
- With hosting weekly multiplayer lobbies, **we will release our recommendations little by little**. To keep things fresh, maps being played in the lobby will change every week. Because of this, we will only publish portions of the whole Beatmap Spotlights every week.
- When a timeshift lobby ends, we want to **award the winners of the timeshift lobbies weekly with a small prize**.
- On top of that we also want to add a **Seasonal Ranking** where we will sum up the results of each timeshift lobby and pit every participant against another with a custom ranking system. We plan to assign a league bracket to every participant, based on their placement in this ranking system (Bronze, Silver, Gold, etc.). Once a season ends, maybe you can even keep your placement in shape of a medal or badge on your profile...?

The aim of this league is to be an alternative, competitive and fun weekly activity for everyone to participate in while we use the mapspools to recommend people the best beatmaps osu! has to offer. This will give beatmaps in the Spotlight the attention they deserve even more.

To accomplish this, we also want to revamp the Spotlights Team as a whole. For that, we are looking for people willing and capable of selecting the best beatmaps created for all kinds of players so we can recommend them to everybody.
**If you want to be part of the new Spotlights Team and help shape this from the very beginning, [you can hand in your application now!](https://spotlights.team/app)**

We are also still looking for a good name for the league we want to add. You can leave your ideas in the comments below.

With that, we hope that you like the new idea and that you can shape the new Spotlights together with us. **[Join us at our Discord server](https://discord.gg/DtQrzyV)** or visit the `#osu-spotlights` channel of osu!dev to help us with this project onwards!
