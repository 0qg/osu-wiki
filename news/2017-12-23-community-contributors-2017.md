If you're unfamiliar with this sort of thing, you may have already seen or noticed a few people wearing the [community contributor badge](https://assets.ppy.sh/profile-badges/contributor.png) on their profile. These respected individuals have at some point in osu!'s history, made massive contributions that have helped shape the game in a number of ways.

Today, we honor many more. 

Do note, there are countless others who contribute massively - this list is by no means exhaustive, and merely represents an acknowledgement of massive, continued contribution over a long period of time as observed by members of the osu!team.

## Community

As of this post, OnosakiHito has since retired from the QAT for a long-earned rest, but the sheer scope and depth of his contributions make this award something long in the running, and we are sad to see him settle down into the quieter years of his time with osu!
