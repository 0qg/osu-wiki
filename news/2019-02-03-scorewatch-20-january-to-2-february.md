Did you miss Scorewatch? We're back again with some insane plays to showcase all around the board. Come check out what the most skilled players in osu! have been up to!

The Scorewatch project has been inactive for quite a while now, but [FayeurS 5](/users/6177263) and I are making an effort to bring it back. For now, we'll be running on a bi-weekly schedule (instead of the previous weekly): we're still working out the organization of this project and don't have a lot of people contributing. Next time, we will have more information about the future of Scorewatch and how you can contribute, if you would like to =).

That being said, let's check out the scores!

[idke](/users/4650315): [AugoEidEs [oyasumi]](/beatmapsets/346104#osu/764082) +HR **A** (2432/2472x, 99.52%) #5  
*20 January 2019, Loved*

Starting us off this week, HardRock extraordinaire idke proves himself with this attempt on AugoEidEs, coming shockingly close to a full combo while holding an accuracy unrivaled by the other HR plays. This map is already a monster without mods, and idke's score here makes it seem as though it's hardly even a challenge for him to add the mod on top of it!

[Gayzmcgee](/users/1419095): [The Near Distant Future [Lapse]](/beatmapsets/97433#osu/260489) +DT **A** (2563/2677x, 99.52%) 496pp  
*29 January 2019, Ranked*

I think everybody forgot to remind Gayzmcgee that you're not supposed to use DT on this map... seriously, it's already a feat of itself to score a full combo on this draining marathon; coming this close to a DT FC (with this insane accuracy) is totally nuts! Words don't do much justice to the level of speed that Gayzmcgee can play well at, so I highly encourage you to watch the video for yourself.

That's a wrap on this round of Scorewatch! Stay tuned for future updates!
