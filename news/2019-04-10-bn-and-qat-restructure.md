Changes to the ranking process are nigh! With recent discussions about [changes to the Quality Assurance Team and Beatmap Nominators](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/862002), we are proud to present to you the following changes.

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/beatmap-management.jpg)

+ The QAT is gone and has been replaced by the new [Nominator Administration Team](https://osu.ppy.sh/groups/7).
+ The Beatmap Nominators (BN) are responsible for disqualifying beatmaps and mediating vetoes from now on, in addition to their task of pushing beatmaps towards the ranked category.
+ The Nominator Administration Team (NAT) are the moderators of the Beatmap Nominators. They are responsible for BN Applications, creating tests for the applicants and for evaluating the current members. They will still have their moderation privileges although it is not their primary focus. 
+ Beatmaps that have been vetoed will be mediated by a random jury made up of members of the BN. The NAT will oversee these mediations. 
+ Probationary Beatmap Nominators now have their own usergroup. These members will have less features compared to the rest of the BNs.

The primary focus of probationary BNs will be to nominate beatmaps, and so will not have the ability to disqualify beatmaps or take part in mediating vetoes. New members of the BNs will be placed in probation for approximately one month before their performance is reviewed by the NAT. They will then be promoted to a regular BN, remain in probation, or be removed from the group completely. Members of the regular BNs may also be demoted to probation if their work is found to not meet standards.

The [Beatmap Nominator rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators/Rules) have been updated accordingly for their new tasks. Moreover, work on a score system as a guideline to evaluate Beatmap Nominators starts now and you can expect a new proposal detailing our plans for that soon!

Additionally to this, the next time BN Applications open, they will stay open indefinitely. More information about how to apply will be released soon.

As osu! is a community driven game, these changes were made to give members of the community more control over what reaches the ranked section. We expect to see improvements in the way beatmap quality is managed, particularly with controversial maps, where the outcome will be more in line with the desires of the community.

With these changes, we unfortunately have had to say farewell to [Fycho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1876867), [Gabe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/654108), [Hobbes2](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8157492), [Kuron-kun](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2697284), [Lanturn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1446665), [p3n](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/123703), [Regraz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3076909), [Raiden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2239480), [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508), and [Protastic101](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6712747) who will not be joining the NAT. Nonetheless, we greatly appreciate their time in the QAT and thank them all for their hard work up until now.

On a more uplifting note, please welcome [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) to the NAT, who will be focusing their efforts on the affairs of the osu!catch nominators!
