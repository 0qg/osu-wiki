The turn of the new year brings about many positive changes, most pressing of which pertains to few open positions in the osu!taiko World Cup 2021. Following this, we have a provisional schedule for all the other gamemode World Cups for the year ahead.

### osu!taiko World Cup 2021

#### Mapper for custom TWC maps

Following the widespread positive reception of custom mapping in OWC 2020, we've decided to take a page out of their playbook and incorporate it into TWC 2021!

Mappers of the osu!taiko gamemode will now have a way to express their interest in mapping exclusively for the TWC! 

Required availability is from now until around the end of March - further details can be found on the application form. 

[Apply here](https://forms.gle/6bHCRSR3LDxo7Acf8) if you are interested in helping out!

#### Commentator/Referee

Commentators and referees aim to provide a great live viewing experience.

While referees are the backbone of the matches, commentators are the faces of the stream. Both require a good grasp on the rules and plenty of free time during weekends from early March to mid April!

[Apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aT7Ln7KWI1p5RkEMLowGDHfZmaaOWHr8hvu6s53J6xA) if you are interested in helping out either as a referee or a commentator!
