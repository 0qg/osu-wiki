Decadence descends upon osu! with the latest addition to the Featured Artist lineup - Imperial Circus Dead Decadence!

[![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/35/header.jpg)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/35)

Held in high regard within the osu! community since their impromptu debut in 2016 with [Kite's iconic beatmap of Uta](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/410162#osu/890190), **Imperial Circus Dead Decadence** have never been far from any thrill-seeking player's mind, their sound firmly established in some of the most difficult and endurance-testing sets that the game has ever seen.

We've thrown the gates to this decadent hell wide open, and are proud to welcome them as [our latest Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/35)!

Intrepid mappers will be delighted to discover **three** albums to pick through at their leisure, all rife with their classic frantically fast-paced, hellishly hectic and monstrously metal sound.

But naturally, don't take our word for it! Here's a few samples of just a snippet of what's available now [over at their Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/35):
