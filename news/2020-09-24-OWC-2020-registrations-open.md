We bashed the drums, catched the fruits, hit the notes, but now is, once again, time to ***click the circles!***. The OWC 2020 is here and registrations are now open!

We are keeping the structure introduced last year with some changes. A Qualifier Stage will define the top 32 teams who will play on the Main Bracket Stage, so if you think you have the skills to compete, is now the time to register.

For details, refer to the **[osu! World Cup 2020 wiki article](/wiki/Tournaments/OWC/2020)**.
You can discuss this event and follow the most important changes in the **[official discussion thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1150567)**.

## How do I register?

- **[Click here to sign-up!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/26)**
- Do not create teams in advance! Teams will be formed by the country's team captain after the registration phase is concluded.
- Hand in your registration before the **8th of October.**

Please note that you may only participate if you are of a **osu! global ranking of #5000 or higher and have not violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months**.

If your registration successfully passes our evaluation, you will be put on the candidate list for your country. Whenever a captain for your country is assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

_Remember that any registrations past the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances - so get your registrations done early to avoid any last-minute issues._
