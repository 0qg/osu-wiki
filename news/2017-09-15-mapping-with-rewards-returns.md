New and improved, the open-form **Mapping With Rewards** mapping contests are back! Map a selection of [Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) tracks for your shot at a variety of prizes, from osu!supporter, custom profile badges, and having your maps bundled with the game!

**Mapping With Rewards** is an open-ended and judged mapping contest first floated in [September 2015](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/129936251068/mapping-with-rewards-sep-2015) with a simple premise: we offer a bounty for the best beatmap set of a [Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists) song, and a big timeframe to complete it in. Casual yet competitive at the same time!

With its return, Mapping With Rewards is just as simple in concept as it was in the past - except this time, it covers *all* gamemodes.

## How does this all work?

It's super simple. We put out some songs, and from the moment this announcement goes live, all of these songs now have a *bounty* on them.

Any beatmap sets for those particular songs that are finished and ready for ranking within the conditions listed below can claim that bounty and enter the judging phase.

All that you need to do to flag your map as ready is to **[send me (Okorin) a private message via the forums with the link to your map on the BSS](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/ucp.php?i=pm&mode=compose&u=1623405).**

If judged to be the best set among all those offered, the map is deemed the winner for that particular gamemode and the mapper is handsomely rewarded for their efforts.

Here's the songs for the first reboot session:

## Songs

### Fractal Dreamers - Fortuna Redux

> The opening track from [Fractal Dreamer's](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/15) debut album *Kingdom of Silence*. Incredibly varied, high tempo EDM track with strong central melodies and thumping percussion. Well suited for mappers who enjoy intense tracks.

</audio>

> From [\*namirin's](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/18) latest album, 5colors. Bright vocals without excessive sweetness, set to a backing track that builds on victorious overtones. Likely familiar to anyone who is fond of anime.

</audio>

> The cinematic climax of [Loki/Thaehan's](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/7) *The Fall of a Hero*. High BPM symphonic metal with prominent electric guitar melodies and leads, set to muted but varied percussion.
+ [3:22 uncut, pre-timed .osz](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/7/osz/Loki%20-%20A%20New%20King%20Is%20Born.osz)

## Bounty
The bounty is claimable **once per gamemode per song** - for the sake of simplicity osu!mania is treated as one gamemode.

If you are judged to be the best map of the lot, here's what you can expect to win:

- 6 months of osu!supporter for you or your friends
- Unique, mode specific MWR 2017 profile badge
- Winning maps will be fast-tracked to Ranked with the dedicated attention of a selection of Beatmap Nominators and Quality Assurance Team members
- Winning maps will also be bundled with osu!lazer when it exits the early development phase (2018)

## Conditions
- **Submissions must be uploaded to the BSS (via the in-game editor)** - it does not matter if they are ranked, pending, graveyarded or whatever else - they will still be judged regardless.
- **Submissions must adhere to the [Ranking Criteria](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Ranking_Criteria)** or be in a state close to satisfying this condition.
    - The bitrate of the songs provides is excluded from this.
    - Custom hitsound samples cannot be used.
- **Collaborations are not allowed because we aim for coherent sets**.
- The participation per gamemode per song will be evaluated in order for a song to be determined to be competitive - the amount of active mappers plays a role here for determining this.
    - **If not enough people of a gamemode map a song, no contest will be held for that particular song and mode.**
- We reserve the right to change the map's background after it has been ranked.
- If a short version of a song is offered, mapping the full version will lead to a bonus in judging.
- The bounty is only awarded to maps that use the versions of the song announced in this post. Other versions, cuts, or remixes do not count.

## Organisation
- There will be **two deadlines**, one is kept vague, one concrete.
    - The contest (and the bounties offered in it) will run for approximately **two months give or take**.
    - If we have reached satisfactory participation by that time, we will announce a hard cutoff in **one month's time** so that everyone that is in the middle of making a map has enough time to finish it and submit it for entry into the current round.
- Judges will be pulled from the Beatmap Nominators and other active modders/mappers via a public judging call.

I look forward to see how this contest pans out and more detailed information to the judging process will follow in future announcements!
