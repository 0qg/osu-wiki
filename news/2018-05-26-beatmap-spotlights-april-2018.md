Starting off his mapping career with a bang, [Damnjelly](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1666355) comes onto the scene with his mapset of "Iwashi ga Tsuchi kara Haete Kurunda". The highest difficulty features an escalation style reading challenge, slowly introducing complex rhythms and culminating with overlapping streams. 

The mapset also features a geometry based spread design, with more angles being introduced per difficulty level, and an incredible recreation of the song's music video in storyboard form.

With his latest ranked map of the song "Gabriel Drop Kick" by Tomita Miyu, Onishi Saori, Ohzora Naomi and Hanazawa Kana, [Okoratu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405) brings us a great collaborative mapset that spans across all modes. 

In his own difficulties, the mapper follows the song perfectly by using structured patterning whenever the music is calm and disheveled patterning when the song is more chaotic. Combined with a guest Insane by [Yuii-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2935923) that uses an interesting hitsounding concept, this mapset is an experience not to be missed this month!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-26-beatmap-spotlights-april-2018/booths-of-fighters.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/730808)

Here comes RoughSketch feat. DD "Nakata" Metal - Booths of Fighters (Camellia's "Barrage of Flurries" Remix) mapped by [LowComboFC](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7322726). This map essentially takes advantage of the complex song structure, managing to combine explosive slider usage and gimmicky stream patterns flawlessly into the extremely variation of the song with an unique aesthetic choice.

For those who are looking for a genuine challenge, this marathon definitely will not disappoint! Call of fighters, call your way!

(Spoiler: watch out your fingers when you tap those 346bpm streams.)

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-26-beatmap-spotlights-april-2018/captivate.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/744587)

Inspired by legendary mappers of the past, [den0saur](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5385151)'s rendition of CaptivAte has left me, and many others, pleasantly surprised. It's sure to invoke nostalgic memories for many of the older players, while also being challenging and engaging for the newer ones. A refreshing marathon to see in the ranked section in recent times and surely a welcome one in the Spotlights!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-26-beatmap-spotlights-april-2018/jojo.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/714329)

[Delis](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1603923) is already well-known as the resident spotlight hogger, but for good reasons! Sono Chi no Sadame is a really intense and epic song, and Delis' representation of the map was done impeccably. High and low points of the song were captured perfectly with variations on spacing and rhythms, and all not without a touch of the classic Delis style™. A solid addition to this month's Spotlight!

While certainly not a stranger to the Spotlights, [iloveyou4ever](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4964596) has outdone himself this time with his map of xi's World Fragments! This ten-minute marathon takes the player through three movements of music, each of which contains everything from sweeping piano passages to calm melodic bits.

What makes this map unique, however, is the way iloveyou4ever approached the song. Every section is distinctly patterned to meld into xi's composition, yet the map still flows cohesively as a whole. This is a selection worth playing through for the experience -- ten minutes will fly by in an instant!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-26-beatmap-spotlights-april-2018/nexta.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/734616)

After the slamming success of both "Cycle Hit" and "We Are Number One" back in 2017, [Midnaait](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1506011) is back again this year with their next(a) hit, lapix's "Nexta"!

Being the winner of the o!Taiko Argentina Mapping Contest, it is no surprise that this gem is included in this month's Spotlights. Featuring several tricky patterns throughout the entirety of the "Data Overwrite" difficulty mixed with SV changes and a brutal long stream at the end, this map will definitely catch any unsuspecting players off-guard.

Not ready for 160BPM streams? No worries, players of all levels will find something to love in this set as there are a total of 5 beautifully crafted difficulties to choose from.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-26-beatmap-spotlights-april-2018/strike.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/713086)

An excellent mapset by [frukoyurdakul](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7612550) who extremely familiar with rock songs. Every difficulties are well mapped especially hardest one 'K.O'. He shows us what's rock song's essence.The triple and stream emphasize guitar, drum and even vocal perfectly. Moreover, the hitsound usage of stream is quite amazing and feels good while playing. If you wants to play 1/3+1/4 stuff, this map might be a good choice.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-26-beatmap-spotlights-april-2018/shitai-ryokou.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/729113)

[Greenshell](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8693851) makes their first Spotlights appearance this month with their map of TAMUSIC's "Shitai Ryokou". The mapper has utilized a fairly simple mapping style to cleanly and effectively accompany the song, focusing mainly on the strong drum beats and on occasion the violin melodies, making for a very intuitive and satisfying play experience.

While the patterns in the map are not that complex overall, the mapper's use of finisher notes throughout does a great job of emphasizing the song's strong drums and makes the map much more challenging and enjoyable to play, even on the lower difficulties. All in all, this is a solid, clean mapset, and is well deserving of its place in this month's Spotlights.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-26-beatmap-spotlights-april-2018/enantiomorphs.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/714685)

Last but most definitely not least, we have [Fallmorph](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5720389) showcasing their high technical mapping skills in Camellia’s "Enantiomorphs". This map is chock full of unbalanced note snappings, tricky streams as well as minor gimmicks which involves sliders, finishers and slider speed changes that all blends together perfectly.

Maintaining a high combo on this map might be easy for the average player, but be warned that getting a high accuracy will be quite the challenge!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-26-beatmap-spotlights-april-2018/turii.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/685428)

[Kyuare](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2705312)'s latest mapset of Turii \~Panta rhei\~ brings us an exhilarating experience! This mid-length mapset has an even spread of 5 decent difficulties, fitting players at all level.

While 1/4 stream patterns are most common in modern osu!catch mapping, this beatmap employs its specialty in a different way. The top Turii difficulty has Kyuare's typical wiggle patterns that definitely give you great challenge. But if you find it too hard, don't worry! The Rain difficulty, which features some tap dashes, can also hype you up! Don't get deceived by star ratings and try your best!

Large multi-mode collaborations can sometimes fall flat if each particular game mode didn't receive enough dedicated attention, but happily this is far from the case here. [Sc4v4ng3r](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4838429)'s osu!catch difficulty spread for "Gabriel Drop Kick" is a beautifully clean affair, but also sports a variety of different patterns and flows fitting each different section.

The fact that Sc4v4ng3r's mapset has managed to reached Ranked status, even when the man himself is on an extended leave of absence from osu! is testament to the quality of his work and the kind efforts of our community. Truly great to see and I hope an eventual return yields more of the same from him.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-26-beatmap-spotlights-april-2018/der-wald.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/581787)

An amazing set of top-quality maps by [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883), [Spectator](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/702598) and [Hareimu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4138746)! Ascendance, as the mapper of the top difficulty, intentionally uses tricky yet decent anti-flows throughout the map, which heavily challenge reading skills and tapping precision. 

The lower two difficulties are also neatly organized with delicate and friendly patterns, making the set enjoyable for fruit lovers of all levels. Don't forget to check it out!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-26-beatmap-spotlights-april-2018/akaito.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/610994)

It's time we could enjoy 1/2 jump party! Surrounded by 1/4-rhythm-based overdoses today, [RoseusJaeger](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/67098409) and [Ascendance](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2931883) are surprisingly gifting us a newly approved mapset, "Akaito" by Rib, with mostly 1/2 patterns. This map features convenient flow and proper emphasis throughout the whole difficulty. Meanwhile it is also able to come up with different patterns that make it colorful and catchy. With Rib's smooth voice, you are about to love playing this map.

"Don't mess the timing with your eyes. Feel the rhythm with your soul!" [Lenfried-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5314573) brings us here the probably most enjoyable and fun mapset which consist only out of easy difficulties! The BASIC consist mostly of 2/1 and 1/1 pattern which got placed in order to the vocals from the music. It's perfect for every new player.

The CHALLENGE difficulty is where the fun begins! The vocal tells you how to play and then the pattern repeat again but with a incredibly high slider velocity, high enough that the notes become unreadable. You have to remember which pattern you played before and listen to the vocal to hit them accurate!

This mapset really deserve it to be the best of the month April. Well done Lenfried-! Would be cool to see more maps like this from you!

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-26-beatmap-spotlights-april-2018/deublithick.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/725078)

[\_underjoy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2235750) came back with his undoubtfully insane 7K mapset with Gekikara Mania's "Deublithick". The spread features with three extreme difficulties, including [Blocko](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4075092) as a guest mapper and an Insane difficulty accompanied by [capsafangirl](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4308015), which present extreme streaming burst at the 1/3 posterior section of the song, along with complex usage of multiple chord stream jump hands.

\_underjoy once again showed his unique and excellent mapping style, encouraging for 7K lovers to once again challenge and test their skills.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-26-beatmap-spotlights-april-2018/onigiri.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/663098)

Debuting his first ranked map, [Mentholzzz](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7182779)'s ONIGIRI FREEWAY by featured artist OISHII is quite the active chart for an active song. Featuring twisting long notes with well crafted inverse sections, it's certainly a break from the established norm. 

Even if long notes aren't your thing, the lower difficulties share the same creative spark that makes the top diff stand out, and to top it all off, it's key sounded! With a little something for everyone, this has definitely earned its place in this month's Spotlights.

[![](/wiki/shared/news/2018-05-26-beatmap-spotlights-april-2018/yell.jpg)](http://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/661022)

[Turrim](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3846265), new mania mapper has made his appearance with his first ranked mapset, DJ Genki VS Camellia feat. moimoi - YELL!

As he showed on many unranked maps, this map also has kind of unusual long note style. There is the well-layered structure, starting from vocal to heavy drum roll backs it up. He focused on the feeling when he faced the part, it makes him to put many long notes at the main melody. Sometimes he excluded the strength of drum for the sake of it, that aids in organization of pattern creativity in the good way. 

The last kiai is made up of full long notes, it gives a challenge to players who are not familiar with them. It's a new challenge for him as 7K mapping, let's give him a round of applause for his best effort!

--------

We hope you enjoy our selection for this month and look forward to what we will bring to you in the future.

Until then, happy clicking, drumming, catching, and hitting the piano notes! Do not forget to have a rest occasionally!

—Kurokami, Mao
