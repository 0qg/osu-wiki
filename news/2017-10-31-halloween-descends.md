**The mischievous spirit that possessed the _osu!_ game client last year has returned again!** Featuring the top ten voted picks from the absolutely outstanding showing from this year's [Halloween Fanart contest](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/56), the main menu has received a brand new set of limited-time seasonal backgrounds, starring the osu! mascots in all of their spooky glory.

And boy, are some of them spooky.

You can check out all of the winning entries over at the [contest listing page](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/56) - and **we highly suggest you do**, because there are some absolutely incredible entries this year!

As with last year, this little client-makeover also features cYsmix's spectacularly spooky remix of the main _osu!_ theme, _pumpkins_.

**There's also a brand new selection of Hush Hush medals available for your achievement-hunting enjoyment.** Don't spoil these for other people who might want to find them!

Here's a few hints to get you started:

- **Thrill of the Chase** - Hunting always was a bit of a classic pursuit.
- **The Girl in the Forest** - First generation in more ways than one.
- **You Can't Hide** - Don't even try to hide.
- **True Torment** - You will suffer.
- **The Firmament Moves** - Three steps does it walk, but most witness only one. Seek the one renewed, four times different from what it was before.
- **Too Fast, Too Furious** - This is scarier than you think.
- **Feelin' It** - Get in the groove and multiply those beats.
- **Overconfident** - Wrecked.
- **Spooked** - Bet you didn't see that coming.

A few of these new medals are considered *exceptionally difficult* in a similar way to the _Equilibrium_ medal from the first set of the new Hush Hush medals. Think outside the box if you go looking!

Happy Halloween from all of us on the osu!team!
