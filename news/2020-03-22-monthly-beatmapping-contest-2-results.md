For those unfamiliar, the **Monthly Beatmapping Contest** (***MBC***) began its comeback in 2020. Everything you'd need to know about the contest is detailed on the [MBC wiki article](/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest), so give it a read.

## Winners

Votes for all finalists can be found on the [contest's listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/89). The main requirement for submissions was that **each could not exceed 4.00 stars.**

**Community vote winner:** **[Voicians - Wolves](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/89/entries/Voicians%20-%20Wolves%20(Conspicuous%20Kite).osz?2020)** by **[Aphestra](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11949191)**, masked as Conspicuous Kite.

Topping with **43** votes, Aphestra's submission made its way to the peak of the community vote poll and was deemed the winner of this month's contest! 

This entry played it relatively safe — it features cleanly organized patterns, intricate slider shapes, and silky smooth gameplay. While you may not earn any performance points from it, it's still a comfortable ride that voters thoroughly enjoyed!

As a reward, Aphestra has earned Monthly Beatmapping Contest's first tier profile badge and two months of osu!supporter.

**Community vote runner-up:** **[Voicians - Wolves](https://assets.ppy.sh/contests/89/entries/Voicians%20-%20Wolves%20(Reckless%20Beaver).osz?2020)** by **[UndeadCapulet](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2523533)**, masked as Reckless Beaver.

Garnering **37** votes, UndeadCapulet's entry barely surpassed the third place entry by 1 vote to rise into second place!

One of the screening crew members, [Uberzolik](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1314547), noted that while most entries focused on creating low star rating yet engaging maps through slider velocity changes, this one took a different approach. Instead, this entry utilized its small circle size to draw out less conventional cursor movements while also employing unusual rhythms to create a stand-out experience. Give it a play if that's what you're into!

As the contest's runner-up, UndeadCapulet earned a month of supporter and is halfway to the first reward tier's profile badge prize! See the rewards breakdown on the [MBC wiki article's rewards section](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Contests/Monthly_Beatmapping_Contest#rewards) for more info about how this works.

**Screening crew's favorite:** **[Voicians - Wolves](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1129015#osu/2358657)** by **[Mao](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515)**, masked as Conscientious Elephant.

Submissions to the MBC are screened by about 10 experienced beatmappers to decide the finalists. This month, Mao's entry placed in the top 5 for 2/3 of those mappers, far surpassing any other entry in terms of screening votes!

While it may be difficult to play because slider velocity bounces all over the spectrum, this entry definitely follows the music in a way that no other entries could stand up against!

Like the runner-up, Mao has earned a month of supporter and is halfway to the prize threshold for a profile badge.

## March's MBC

To see a bit more engagement with next month's community vote, we're going to make things easier for you by limiting the finalists to the **top 5** and showcasing video previews for each of them. Let's see how things pan out!

With all that said, we can finally conclude February's MBC. Remember that March's contest is about to end, so if you think you can quickly create a map without any slider velocity changes, give its [contest listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/91) a peek.

Until next month!
