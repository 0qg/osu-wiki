## How do I register?

- **[Click here to sign-up!](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/tournaments/29)**
- Do not create teams in advance! Teams will be formed by each country's team captain after the Registration Phase is concluded.
- Submit your registration before **July 23.**

*Notice: you may only participate if your osu!mania Global Ranking is #5000 or higher, and you have not violated the [osu! community rules](/wiki/Rules) in the past 12 months*.

If your registration passes our internal checks, you will be placed on the candidate list for your country. When that country's captain has been assigned, the list will be sent to them. This may take a while, so please be patient.

*Remember that any registrations submitted after the deadline will not be considered under any circumstances — submit your registration ahead of schedule to avoid any last-minute issues.*
