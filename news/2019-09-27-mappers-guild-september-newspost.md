![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/mappersguild.png)

As you may know, since March 2019, the **[Mappers' Guild](https://mappersguild.com)** is open to everyone that have at least *three* ranked maps, which made the Guild very productive in terms of mapping and modding contents. The introduction of the quest system reinforced the teamwork spirit between mappers to produce more content in a collaborative way, while keeping a MMO-style process.

The Mappers' Guild is a group of experienced mappers which its goal is to produce official content for the game, exclusively from Featured Artist songs while rewarding mappers with points depending on their individual contribution. The quests are usually artist-specific, but can sometimes be thematic, such as Vocaloid-themed quests for instance, which mixes several artists in one quest.

If you're curious and you want to know more about the Guild, please visit [the official Mappers' Guild website](https://mappersguild.com)!

From now on, on a monthly basis, we'll be posting a newspost to keep you informed about the progress of the Mappers' Guild events, such as finished quests, but also some standalone sets that have been made by the Guild members.

Considering there is a lot of finished quests, we will only list the ones that involves a lot of mapsets and mappers.

Please note that there is few other finished quests, but since they include less than 5 mapsets, we decided to not having them here, to avoid having a bloated newspost.

In the future, we plan to have a shorter and more cleanly designed newspost. This post was initially made to introduce the concept and also to keep people informed about the progess of the Mappers' Guild since the [last newspost](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/news/2018-03-17-new-mappers-guild-pack-release) about it.

See you next time!
