A new shiny news post was spotted at the horizon and coming to you now every month. It’s the **Mappers’ Report**! This news post series will inform you monthly about happenings within the osu! mapping scene.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2020-02-18-mappers-report/the_mappers_report.jpg)

Some of you may remember the old [QAT Gazette](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Quality_Assurance_Team_Blog) articles. This will be something similar, yet different. The Mappers’ Report news posts will keep you up to date with Ranking Criteria changes, NAT meetings, and team movements. Additionally, we will include mapping related wiki changes. 
We even have something new in the works! The “Mapper Showcase” will be a section where each month we write about one mapper who deserves more attention. A mapper can be featured because of some unique mapping style, amazing storyboards or even just outstanding hitsounding. And don’t worry, the game mode will switch every month. No one will be left out!

With that being said, let’s begin right away with the news!

This month's issue of the Mappers’ Report contains following topics:
- [**Ranking Criteria Changes**](#rcchanges)
- [**NAT Meetings**](#natmeetings)
- [**Within the Beatmap Nominators and NAT**](#withinbnnat)
- [**Mapping Contests**](#mapping_contests)
- [**Summary**](#summary)


## <a id="rcchanges"></a>Ranking Criteria Changes

A new month brings a new avalanche of updates to the Ranking Criteria (RC). These past two months were especially productive with the implementation of rules!

### General

- [**Custom Difficulty Naming Updates**](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Ranking_Criteria#rules.1): 
A description has been added to the rule “A beatmapset's custom difficulty naming must follow a common theme or pattern related to the song…” to clarify its meaning.
- [**Spread and Length Requierements**](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Ranking_Criteria#rules.1): The requirement that drain time must be 80% of play time has been removed from the point that “Difficulties lower than the highest difficulty can use their play time as a metric instead of drain time”.
- [**Sped Up Ver. Markers**](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Ranking_Criteria#rules.2): Songs that have been edited to have a higher tempo are now required to use a (Sped Up Ver.) marker in the title field. For songs where the genre is Techno, Trance, Dance, or other similar genres, (Nightcore Mix) will be used instead.
- [**Hitsound File Length**](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Ranking_Criteria#rules.4): The minimum length for hitsound files has been reduced from 100ms to 25ms, after testing showed that 25ms hitsound files will behave correctly in-game.
- [**Cutting Songs Guideline Changes**](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Ranking_Criteria#guidelines.4): Cuts are required to maintain the general impression and intensity of the full song, however the guideline about the cuts having to be 1:30 or above in length has been removed. 
- [**Background Requirements**](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Ranking_Criteria#rules.5): New minimum width and height sizes have been added in addition to the already present maximum width and height rules. The new minimum sizes are 160 pixels wide and 120 pixels high. 
- [**Background Quality Guideline**](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Ranking_Criteria#guidelines.5): A new guideline has been added specifying that background images must be of reasonable quality.

### osu!taiko

- **Drum Sampleset**: A rule was removed which forbade the use of the drum sampleset. Previously, the game had no drum sample set support for osu!taiko, but this was fixed and samples added. Thus, the rule has been removed as the sampleset is now usable.

### osu!catch

- [**HP Difficulty Guidelines**](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/osu!catch#difficulty-specific): The difficulty specific guidelines for HP settings have been adjusted for Cup to Overdose to be in line with community standards.

### osu!mania

- [**Hitsound Additions Requirements**](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Ranking_Criteria#rules.4): Following this change, osu!mania beatmapsets containing only difficulties of Insane or above do not require hitsound additions. 
- [**Difficulty name requirements**](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/osu!mania#rules):
A new specification has been added that sets with a single key mode must not use the key mode in the difficulty name.
- [**Long note changes in Easy and Normal**](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/osu!mania#-easy):
The previous guidelines in Easy and Normal that "A long note cannot be released during another long note's body" have been removed. They have been replaced with "long note releases should be at least 1/1 beat from each other" for Easy difficulties and "long note releases should be at least 1/2 beat from each other" for Normal difficulties.


## <a id="natmeetings"></a>NAT Meetings

The past 2 months have been filled with public meetings organized by the NAT, aimed at improving the ranking system based on community input. A wide range of topics such as BN/NAT activity requirements or transparency of the application process for both groups have been covered so far, and there is more to come! If you wish to participate in future meetings, join the [osu!dev discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) and go through the verification process.

Upcoming meetings will be announced with a specific time and agenda in the #modding channel of the osu!dev Discord server, as well as in an announcement post in the [Mapping Discussion](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/56) forum. The next meeting is scheduled for 1st of March, but the topic and agenda are still being worked on and will be announced soon.	

### [Jan 3rd, 2020 - Promotion of NAT Members](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1006119)

The most important information which was discussed during this meeting was the addition of new NAT and its team size. The NAT wiki article has also been updated to include relevant information such as how the team size of the NAT depends on what is needed and in what work fields. If more help in one work field is required, a new NAT will be considered. 

### [Jan 18th, 2020 - Application Evaluation](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1012519)

The BN application mod requirements have been made more clear, and the BN website also received several improvements, the biggest one being a “Would you nominate this map. If not, why?” checkbox on the application form. It vastly improves the fair evaluation system.

Another important topic was the “taiko care package”. As the name suggests, this was a system implemented in osu!taiko, where so far it has been successful! This program allowed old osu!taiko BNs which left on good terms to rejoin the Beatmap Nominators more easily. The results will be analyzed and we in the NAT hope to implement a similar system for all game modes later this year!

### Feb 1st, 2020 - Progress Report

This meeting has no summary because it was more of a progress report. It looked at the goals of the past meetings and if these were successfully implemented. Most of the goals were reached so the meeting wasn’t very long.
Another topic was how frequently meetings should be held and how this would work going forward. As long as there are topics which need discussion, the meetings will be held regularly. This should slow down in future, and when it does we will have more progress reports and fewer meetings. 

### [Feb 15th, 2020 - Current BN Evaluations](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1023943)

The first point the meeting discussed was the activity threshold which is required for a Beatmap Nominator every month. The conclusion from the meeting is that Beatmap Nominators for osu!, osu!taiko and osu!catch need at least 3 nominations per month on average, and osu!mania will need 2 nominations on average each month. The activity will be regularly checked every two months by the NAT. Another point of the discussion was how nomination resets will affect the evaluation of the Beatmap Nominators. Unranks will no longer weigh more than regular nomination resets. 
Last but not least, Beatmap Nominators will also be judged by the map quality of their nominations. This is to ensure a fair evaluation. Beatmap Nominators could have a high nomination count, but all maps could be of low quality. To ensure this does not happen the NAT will judge the quality of the nominations.

### BN Additions

Within the last few months we’ve had the chance to say hello to a lot of new members to the Beatmap Nominators, especially from the osu!taiko side of things! We’re very glad to have all these people on board whether they are new to the group or are returning veterans. We look forward to their help with pushing content to the Ranked section.
