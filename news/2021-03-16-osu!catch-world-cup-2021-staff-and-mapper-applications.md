### Mapper for custom CWC maps

Following the trend of including custom maps, as seen in the past OWC 2020 and also in community tournaments like the recent AxS sixth edition, we'd also like to incorporate those into the mappool for the upcoming CWC 2021!

Mappers of the osu!catch gamemode will now have the chance to help out creating exclusive maps for the CWC! 

Required availability is from now on until the end of May - further details can be found on the application form. 

[Apply here](https://forms.gle/fP98XSM5h3hYb1Ex5) if you are interested in helping out!

### Commentator/Referee

Commentators and referees aim to provide a great live viewing experience.

We are currently looking for experienced commentators for the osu!catch gamemode. This would require you to be available on weekends from late April to early June!

[Apply here](https://forms.gle/XcpXMrYtGDZHVcmQ7) if you are interested in helping out either as a referee or a commentator!
