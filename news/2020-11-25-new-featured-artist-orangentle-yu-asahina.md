**orangentle / Yu_Asahina** squeezes in as our newest Featured Artist!

Carrying a mix of jazz, EDM, and an ever-engaging rhythm game sound, it's impossible to nail down the breadth of works released by [**orangentle / Yu_Asahina**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/118). Following their debut BMS submission in 2004, they've been producing a massive variety of music for nearly two decades leaning towards rhythm game audiences (that's you!).

We've picked up **20** new tracks from 5 of their albums and single releases, shining a spotlight on the diverse mastery of **orangentle / Yu_Asahina**'s sound.

Take a peek at what we've got in store:
