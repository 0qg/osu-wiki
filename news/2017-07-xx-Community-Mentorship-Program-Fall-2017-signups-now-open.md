Have you ever thought: “Wow, I’m bad at mapping”? Does the quote “So let’s be honest, you suck at mapping” (pishifat, 2016)  strike a personal chord with you? Then the Community Mentorship Program is the place for you!

[seems to need a banner of sorts?]

Since the beginning of the mentorship program in July of 2016, the program has gone through four cycles each lasting approximately 10 weeks. Aspiring mappers have been taught the fundamentals of mapping from experienced mappers in the community, and some have even gone on to rank their own beatmaps!


What is the Community Mentorship Program?
-----
Getting into mapping is challenging and the learning curve is steep. Most mappers nowadays struggle to find a reliable basis to learn mapping from. After all, the editor lacks a built-in tutorial, and modding is difficult to get into without basic mapping knowledge.

Experienced mappers and modders, such as nominators, or even players, are often found busy or uninterested. Getting consistent feedback on your maps from the same people can therefore be difficult, as few would be interested in teaching someone new to the field.

With this in mind, the program aims to provide a means for mappers to seek out more personalized assistance, rather than resorting to more obscure methods to fuel their learning spirit. By incorporating newer mappers into the mapping community, the ability to seek necessary feedback required for the ranking and modding processes becomes much easier as well.

How it works
-----
Mentor applicants go through a selection process based on their demonstrated mapping and modding proficiency and are then given the role, should they pass as capable. Afterwards, anyone looking to apply as a mentee can do so by filling out a mentee application.

A mentor may choose to pick one or multiple mentees depending on their experience with the program. Provided the pair decide to work together, they will be in a mentee/mentor relationship for the whole cycle, lasting 10 weeks.

Mentor/mentee relationships allow for the mentee to ask specific questions and get help that is tailored to their needs. In doing so it eliminates the need for the mentee to filter out the information they don’t need from that which they do, streamlining the learning process and allowing for significantly more progress to be made than otherwise.

There is also the opportunity to mingle with the other current and former participants of the program, for example other mentees or mentors. Discussions concerning mapping are common in the process of each cycle. This mapping-centered environment is full of information any aspiring mapper is sure to find useful.

Activities
-----
+ **Speedmapping contests** - mentees have a time limit to produce a creative map to a given song.
+ **Traditional mapping contests** - in which mentees are given a song and a long period of time to create a difficulty for it.
+ **Mapping discussions** - mentors give a lecture about specific mapping concepts or aspects in mapping.
+ **Group modding/multiplayer lobbies** - mentees give feedback on each others’ maps through testing them.

Contests and discussions are hosted at least twice per cycle. They are not mandatory to participate in, but doing so is usually a valuable learning experience. The purpose of these is providing motivation for mentees to map and experiment so mentors and mentees alike have topics for discussion in their own private lessons.

The contests encourage mentees to put in their best effort and perhaps experiment with new things to gain that competitive edge. Mentors are allowed to guide their mentees in a general sense but are prohibited from directly changing the map.

osu!catch Integration
-----
Lastly, the osu!catch mentorship discord will now be merging with the osu!standard mentorship discord, and community members from both modes will be part of the same server. There is a possibility of integrating the osu!mania and osu!taiko mentorship programs as well, but nothing has been finalized as of yet.
