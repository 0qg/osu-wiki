For over a month and a half we have embarked on yet another glorious journey to celebrate the year. The osu! World Cup 2018 welcomed 32 teams from across the globe, who competed to showcase their skills in moments of glory. Of the 32 teams, 3 arrived at the Grand Finals weekend – Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States – to fight for the title of the osu! champion 2018.

Something setting the 2018 OWC apart from previous years' is that for the first time this year, we have a "Grand Finals Mappool", where map difficulties spike up by one more notch, while at the same time sparing the players from having to play the same pool for two weeks.

The first two teams up to play are Germany and the United Kingdom. Led by veteran and star players [Dustice](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/754565) and [Okinamo](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3765989), the German players are making history, returning once again to the Top 3 for the first time since 2014. Their core skillsets are solid, and consistency prowess renowned. However, standing in their way is Team UK, united under a roster stronger than ever this year and looking to become the second European team to be crowned since Poland last year. All-star players Bubbleman and Spare became the backbone their team could depend upon as the English players charged at the German defense line. Despite constantly under pressure, the German players fought back, not wanting to repeat their history last year against the same opponent. This valiant effort, though in the end did not pay out, earned them praises from both the audiences and their opponents. In the end, Germany conceded defeat at 4-7. This still serves as a historical milestone for the German players, and surely would only ignite their ambition to overcome more obstacles and climb higher in future OWCs.

The stage then was set for the true Grand Finals to take place on December 16th, 2018, where two-time champion Team USA will be challenged by Team UK before they can win their third title. Over recent years, the United States osu! scene has seen an astronomical expansion since their advent in 2015, with new and skilled players showing up like mushrooms after a fresh rain in the forest.

"(Forming this year's roster is) the hardest decision we've made," said veteran player Toy, elucidating that any player not present on their roster is not due to their skills: "we could only pick 8."

The result of that decision was the strongest USA roster to date.

Meanwhile, the English players most certainly did not cower at the sight of their menacing opponents. Their eyes have been on the prize since the very beginning, and #ItsComingHome was their call. Throughout this tournament, [Bubbleman](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5182050), [OPJames](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4117142), [Spare](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204373), [Doomsday](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/18983), [MoeYandere](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2565902), [SoraRoxas01](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1986262), [Jameslike](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2415743), and [Karthy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4196808) all found moments to shine. Needless to say, their journey up to this point has been a team effort. Arriving at the Grand Finals multiplayer lobby is their ultimate testimony.

"It was great to be part of the team for the first time after playing for so long," commented MoeYandere, Team UK's new blood this year: "I felt extremely nervous with the expectations weighing down, but team definitely made me feel at ease."

Surely enough, the 16 players all feel some different levels of stress coming into this showdown, and they only have themselves and each other to depend upon.

Team USA started the first match strong, taking 3 points in a row. Playing with both grace and grit, [Toy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2757689), [idke](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4650315), and [fireyrage](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3533958) took turns bringing points to their team again and again. On the other side, Bubbleman held down his fort with Spare, producing high combos while eyeing for a weakness in the American line of defense. Counter-picking on [Bad Elixir](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/878944#osu/1838165), they finally broke the American momentum, followed by their own unwavering and impressive showcase of Unravel and Towards the Horizon. The two teams then continued their CQC before arriving at 5-5, and Team USA securing [Tabi to Ferry](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/704541#osu/1490377) with a strongarm performance from Toy. Their next pick – [me & you](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/699749#osu/1481624) – an American favourite to win, was suddenly interrupted in its tracks when players began breaking left and right, and the only one to hold through with a full combo was Bubbleman! To make matters more intense, the point difference at the end was a mere 70! Thus, upon first set of the Grand Finals, we are already seeing a Tiebreaker!

(A mere 70 points difference to give the American players a PTSD attack)

The Tiebreaker map – [The Azure Arbitrator](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/427166#osu/922172) – was a gruesome 8-minute test of high speed consistency, and widely regarded as a deserving but also hard map choice for its purpose. Going into the map, it came as no surprise when the American team wavered and collapsed combos. However, what was surprising was that when the crowd discovered Bubbleman holding combo, maintaining that incredible score growth for Team UK all the way up to more than 2467 before breaking! This amazing feat alone accounted for more than 1/3 of Team USA's score at the end, giving Team UK the much-needed bracket reset, and paved way for the second match!

After a quick break the teams returned for the final showdown of the year. At this point, Twitch channel viewer count broke 13,000, and hype was in the air. Tournament organizer HappyStick went over and congratulated Bubbleman in person, who only responded: "Not yet. It’s not done yet. I'm not done yet."

After witnessing what Team UK could do on [Unravel](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/731933#osu/1544460), Team USA adjusted strategy and banned that map instead. The two teams traded blows until arriving at 2-2, when Team USA saw an opening and went in for the offense, taking 2 more points, bringing the score to 4-2. Team UK quickly reorganized a counterattack, tying the score at 4-4. However, fatigue is definitely showing among the players, and the almost 3-hour long battle is taking its toll! Team UK soon discovered their consistency waning on [Bassdrop Freaks](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/806859#osu/1693575). Team USA followed up with their signature pick Tabi to Ferry. Finally, Bad Elixir sealed the fate for Team UK, giving the win to Team USA at 7-4!

### Results

And just like that, the biggest spectacle of this year for the osu! community has drawn its conclusion. Team USA will be crowned champions for the third time, but Team UK and Team Germany most certainly made their own share of history. While we all have our picks for the MVP, all players who participated deserve a round of applause, for it is them we look up to and them that will inspire future player generations to rise up. This year has been one wild ride, and we look forward to seeing you again next year!
