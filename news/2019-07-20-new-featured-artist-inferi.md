Delving deeper into the pits of the highly complex and commanding sound of metal and its subgenres, **Inferi** stands atop the Featured Artist lineup as the premiere standard for intense, powerful songwriting and musical talent.

We're happy to announce *30* fearsome tracks spanning **Inferi**'s three latest albums: From the highly praised concept album *The Path of Apotheosis*, through the nine rings of hell within *Revenant*, to the Rebirth of their 2009 album *The End of an Era*, **Inferi** is a relentless powerhouse within the technical death metal scene.
