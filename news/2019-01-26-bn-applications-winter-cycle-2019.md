Even though the new year is still full of uncertainties about the future of Beatmap Moderation, the show must go on, and so the Beatmap Nominator applications may start once again!

In the last cycle of applications, there was a total number of 120 participants. After double-checking their modding activity, we established that 96 of the applicants were active enough in previous months, in order to continue with the selection process. Lastly, and after further deliberations within the members of the Quality Assurance Team , we proudly announced at the end of October the addition of no less than 29 new BN members. We hope to see a similar positive result for this cycle!

## How do I apply?

You will have until **January 31st (23:59 UTC)** to [submit your application](https://goo.gl/forms/UIRGtloGypAAhitX2). Processing through applications may take up to three weeks. The basic criteria which applies to all applicants are as follows:

+ You should have been modding actively for at least 3 months prior to the announcement
+ Experienced modders from **all game modes** may apply
+ Each modder can only apply for **one specific game mode** per application. If you want to apply for yet another specific game mode, you may send another application
+ You must be familiar with the current modding environment and abide by the current [Code of Conduct](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/Code_of_Conduct)
+ You must also be familiar with the [Ranking Criteria](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) and apply it where needed in your mods

More information about activity requirements and the selection process can be found as usual in the [Beatmap Nominators wiki article](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/People/Beatmap_Nominators#becoming-a-beatmap-nominator)

We wish the best of luck to all applicants, and hope to see enough reinforcements for all game modes to ensure the number of Ranked beatmaps keeps growing!
