It was once said by peppy himself that a game simply isn't a rhythm game unless it has Cranky in it. For years, this title has eluded us, ever so slightly out of grasp - but no longer! Today, we welcome **Cranky** as our latest (and perhaps greatest) Featured Artist.

**Cranky** is such a major fixture of rhythm gaming music that we can't even really begin to do his legacy justice, so we'll just let his work speak for him. 

The musical genius behind countless entries in many other rhythm games like *SOUND VOLTEX*, *jubleat plus* and more, **Cranky**'s work is the very definition of diverse, spanning across dozens of genres and sounds while always retaining those core hits that help drive rhythm games as a whole.

To usher him in, the Mappers' Guild have been hard at work creating an ensemble of **8** brand new, freshly Ranked beatmaps for your playing pleasure:

Beyond these fine tracks, there are **over 70 more for a total of 79 tracks available** for mapping in osu!, all pre-timed and roaring to go on [his Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/23).

If you like what you hear, make sure to check out **Cranky's** label, [Feline Groove](http://www.feline-groove.com/) for all the latest information about his work, and maybe consider following him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_cranky), saying hello on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hiroshi.watanabe.587260), or just listening to the rest of his works over at his [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/felinegroove). 

**Cranky**'s addition as our 23rd Featured Artist also denotes a big milestone for the project - we now have over 500 tracks totalling nearly **30 hours** of non-stop musical goodness totally free for use in osu! mapping.

The hype doesn't stop here however, we've got bigger and better things planned, so keep your eyes peeled in the coming weeks for hints of what's on the horizon...
