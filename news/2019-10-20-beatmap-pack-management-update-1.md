An update to the Beatmap Pack Management project, including new pack releases!

![](/wiki/shared/news/banners/beatmap-packs.jpg)

Our project is called Beatmap Pack Management and we are focused on development of the Beatmap Packs. Many of you might not even know who we are or what we are doing, so I'd like to present some information about us:

I've created a small group of experienced users who are interested in working on handmade charts dedicated to specific themes, ideas, or beatmaps which share similarities. Since July 2019, we've been actively working to provide new theme packs of decent quality with interesting concepts. Interest in this project is very high and some noteworthy members of the community have joined the group to help us by contributing their ideas to the project. We already have a few things to present to you, and I am sure you'll like them.

### Alternator Style packs

lain and Uberzolik were passionate enough to work on the very first mapping style specific beatmap packs ever released. These two packs are focused on beatmaps where alternating is essential. lain has worked on the ranked version while Uberzolik took care of the Loved version. If you need maps to practice alternating or are good at it already and want to challenge yourself, you should check these packs out!

### The Embodiment of Scarlet Devil pack

Available to download now, the pack is the first of the Touhou Game Packs, where a selection of various Touhou maps from a specific game is picked and curated just for you! This pack contains beatmaps from the first non PC-98 Touhou game and the sixth game in the series - Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. The pack aims to offer a variety of styles and themes, ranging from 2008 to 2018 to offer something enjoyable for everyone. Packs for future games are currently in progress and should be released within the next few weeks. Enjoy!

Ever wanted to see what popular maps looked like in earlier eras of the game? Well now you can! Forged together by members of the Beatmap Pack Management team, you can check out some of the best maps that the game had to offer during 2010 and 2011 in a single pack. While there is a lot of great maps, the team didn't have enough room to include everything, so hopefully you can find something on this list that you will enjoy. Play through them all and experience a blast from the past!

### osu!dan project

*written by [celerih](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4696296)*  

The osu!dan project is a brand new community created project that seeks to provide a sort of "campaign mode" to the game. Players will progress through levels of increasing difficulty in a skill of their choice, such as aim, stamina, accuracy, et cetera.

Each of the dans will contain 20 levels of increasing difficulty. In order to complete a level, the player must reach the requirements on the maps presented, like reaching a certain accuracy threshold or attaining a full combo. For now, the release of dan levels is purely for fun, a way to practice, or test yourself, but a more official implementation is planned for the future. ðŸ˜‰

The first of the dans is available to download now on the Beatmap Packs listing. The skill tested in this pack is aim and will surely push your circle clicking to the limits. The requirements for this dan are quite simple: you need to achieve full combo on 10 out of 11 maps in the dan to progress to the next one. Once again, this for now is just for your own practice, or to compare yourself with your friends - there is no implementation for keeping track of levels as for now.

If you wish to help with playtesting future packs and stay up to date, you can join [the official osu!dan Discord server](https://discord.gg/b7cVmGd) now!

### October Loved packs

*written by [Stefan](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/626907)*

As it is time to bundle a few beatmaps again, there are some new packs for Loved beatmaps available since yesterday. I want to take the chance to explain why I did not bundle the latest maps from Loved already - since there is always a small chance that a beatmap can get unloved (and therefore unranked) it's a bit tedious to keep track of these things. I decided to give maps at least a minimum of 10 months to stay in Loved, and to bundle them afterwards into packs. While it's no guarantee they will stay in Loved forever, it works for me and I'll go by that for now. Changes can always happen though and I am open for alternatives.

### What else to expect

While I believe we're doing very well already, we're just about to start and currently I'm the only active person that coordinates the uploads, as well as the accessibility and maintenance of the packs so it's a bit slow. But I'm glad I could help a lot of people so far and that I have received so much great feedback. If you are interested in taking a look at what we are working on, or if you have to report an error/bug in a pack, you can join our project server and spectate our doings. Alternatively, if you are interested to work in the group you can join it too! Please check out the [thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/933379) for information on how to get to the server.

I also recommend following [@osuMapPacks](https://twitter.com/osuMapPacks) on Twitter to stay up-to-date with news, fixes, new packs and more. With that said, I can't really say when the next news post will be, since we're a group that takes time to work on packs individually, but you can still contact me if you have any questions. I hope you have an amazing day and download lots of packs, thank you for reading!
