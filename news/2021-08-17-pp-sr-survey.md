In case you're not clued in, development of osu!'s scoring systems happens mostly on the [osu!dev Discord](https://discord.gg/ppy), with discussions taking place both on Github and in the #difficulty channels for a given game mode.

In recent times, there have been conflicting opinions about what the path forward should look like. To help clear the air, we're putting out a short survey to better discover the expectations that all of you have for how things should be.

[**If you want to get involved, please click this link to get started!**](https://forms.gle/hvRaY3B19wCjD9tDA)

This survey should take no more than 5 minutes to complete, so make sure to pass the news along to any of your friends that might be interested!

We'll be making the results of this poll visible in **2 weeks time** so that everybody can get a feel for the kind of direction that your fellow circle-clickers seek.
