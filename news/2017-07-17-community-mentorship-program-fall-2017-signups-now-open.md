Have you ever thought about getting more involved in the mapping community, but have no idea where to begin? The Community Mentorship Program may be the place for you!

![Community Mentorship Program](wiki/shared/news/2017-07-17-community-mentorship-program-fall-2017-signups-now-open/banner2.jpg)

Since the beginning of the mentorship program in July of 2016, the program has gone through four cycles, each lasting approximately 10 weeks. Aspiring new mappers have been taught the fundamentals of mapping from experienced mappers in the community, and some have even gone on to rank their own beatmaps!

The mentorship program is a place where newer mappers can seek out personalized assistance with developing their mapping knowledge. Activities include mapping contests, discussions, and playtesting each other’s maps for feedback.

If you want to apply - either as a mentor or mentee - fill in the application forms found on the forum post for cycle #5! Mentor applications are open until July 28th and mentee applications will run from July 30th to August 11th.
