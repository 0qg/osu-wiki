**Grynpyret** makes waves as our latest Featured Artist!

![](https://assets.ppy.sh/artists/159/header.jpg)

Ever since they began releasing their own brand of eccentric melodies on SoundCloud in 2014, **Grynpyret** (pronounced "green parrot") has been a pioneer to the electronic music sphere. Their sound is a blend of comforting relaxation and peculiarity, involving a ton of sound samples that you won't find in any other music.

We've scored **9** tracks this time around, including the cult classic behind [*Boba Beach*](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/327224) hosted by [VINXIS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4323406).

Words can never describe the feeling behind each of these works. To experience them for yourself, try watching [Feiri](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3214844) play *Boba Beach* with osu!lazer's new Barrel Roll mod, and check out the rest of the samples below:

Everything above plus a decent chunk more are available from [**Grynpyret**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/159) with timing all done in advance! While these songs may not be the high intensity tracks you've come to expect from rhythm games, they're all legitimately treats well worth tasting.

That's all for now, but there's always more on the horizon. Our next release includes a pretty hefty batch of songs, so listen closely to the [@osugame Twitter](https://twitter.com/osugame/) for news on that and a few more things we've got in store (like [A Labour of Love](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/115)'s contest results livestream tomorrow!).

Until then!
