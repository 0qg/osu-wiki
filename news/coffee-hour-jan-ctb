If there's one thing that sets osu! apart from other communities, it's the amount of different stories to be told. This episode of Coffee Hour will be the first in a series of Gamemode Showcases where we'll dive into the unique story behind each gamemode. First up: osu!catch.

## This week's theme

We're dedicating our first Gamemode Showcase to osu!catch, the second gamemode to join the osu! ranks all the way back in 2008. Joining me [(HappyStick)](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/HappyStick) this Friday will be [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/jbhyperion) and [Sartan](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/Sartan).

TO DO:

Paragraph 1: line about osu!catch

Paragraph 2: jbhyperion introduction

Paragraph 3: sartan introduction

We have two goals this episode. On the one hand we want to instill osu!catch players with a sense of pride and deeper understanding of the mode they've grown to love. On the other we want to give the uninitiated a new perspective, hopefully even a spark of curiosity into giving osu!catch a try.

## Questions?

As per usual, **we're looking for your questions!** 

If you have questions for either JBHyperion or Sartan, or suggestions for specific osu!catch moments over the years that you want to hear more about, let us know below!

We'll choose the top upvoted comments to present to the guests for discussion on the show.

## When is this happening?

The next episode of the osu! Coffee Hour will be happening this Friday, the [12th of January, at 12PM UTC](http://itsalmo.st/#osucatchshowcase) over at [osulive](http://www.twitch.tv/osulive).

We'll see you then!
