It's been a long time coming, but these two incredibly popular events are making a grand return in 2021, first focusing on catching up on 2019 during this June and July before moving on to cover all of 2020's beatmaps later in the year.

With all-new redesigned websites for these two titanic events, it's never been easier to get involved and have your say on what beatmaps really made the game tick, so make sure to read on below for all the details, dates and everything else you need to become a part of things.

## A Year In Mapping 2019

AYIM is back at long last for another round of highlighting the achievements and statistics of the mapping community in 2019. 


### Statistics
As in previous editions, each mode will have a section of statistics such as who ranked the most sets, how many difficulties were ranked overall, the extremes in difficulty levels we saw ranked, and many, many more records than you can think of. You like interesting fun facts, trivia, fancy numbers? AYIM has all of those covered for the beatmaps and mappers ranked in 2019.

### Commenting on 2019 mappers

In previous years, organizers were responsible for writing comments on each mapper ranked that year. These comments would sum up their achievements and place in the 2019 community. Everyone contributes their part, and AYIM seeks to help put that out there for others to see, learn, and appreciate. For an idea of what that has looked like in the past, check out the [AYIM 2018 Forum thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/966004).

**Here's what's new:** This time, we're opening up writing these comments to *everyone*. Know some banger beatmaps from 2019 or a mapper who left a huge impression on you at that time? Somebody helped mod your beatmap in 2019 and you remember it to this day? Any contribution they made on a personal or larger level in 2019 is fair game to write a comment about. Let them know your thoughts by posting your comments to the website. Again, this is open for everyone to participate in, so let your positivity be heard!

Writing comments will be open **until** the results of MCA are posted.

All of these statistics and features can be found on the [AYIM Website](https://ayim.corsace.io/2019)

## Mapper's Choice Awards 2019

The Mapper's Choice Awards are to mappers of that year what Community Choice is to the general community, with extra bells and whistles in the forms of different categories and multiple winners for each. It is one of the biggest mapping events in the year, and has run anually since 2016. After a hiatus, MCA is now making its grand return to round up 2019. If you'd like to see previous years, check out their forum threads: [2016](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/544747), [2017](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/734377), and [2018](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/966003). In previous editions, we saw participation from hundreds of mappers to help select what they think are the best of the best of the year.

Again this time around, MCA is an event where eligible users can participate in nominating and voting on the best beatmaps of each of the four game modes as well as storyboards throughout multiple different categories. Eligible users are those who ranked a beatmap, guest difficulty, or storyboard in 2019. Alongside the specific categories for particular kinds of beatmaps, storyboards, and mappers, each mode also has grand mapper and grand beatmap categories to highlight the overall best of the best.

MCA has three stages: Nomination, voting, and results.

- **Nomination:** Eligible users can submit any beatmaps/storyboards or users from 2019 they feel are deserving of recognition in their respective categories.
- **Voting:** Eligible users can vote on the pool of submitted nominations.
- **Results:** Will be based off the results of voting and feature a livestream discussing each of the top winners. 

Those who win regular awards on their beatmaps or storyboards in the results will be given 2 months of supporter, and grand prize winners will receive 6 months of supporter.

Overall, this event will give perspective on what the community of that time finds to be the best beatmaps of the year and will serve as an awesome reminder of what we've seen from 2019! 

Nomination and voting will be happening through the [MCA Website](https://mca.corsace.io), so be sure to check it out.
