**Hi, I'm Eiuh and I'll be writing the recaps for the osu!taiko World Cup this year.** I couldn't get started with the group stage recap in time last week, but I'll start off by quickly covering it here to give you some background to the Round Of 16. Better late than never, right?

Because of so many group stage matches being blowouts, **I'll focus heavily on a select few matches**, including upsets that caused crucial changes to the elimination bracket.


### Group Stage Matches

The Group Stage started off with Australia setting the tone for the weekend. In spite of Finland putting up a valiant fight and winning a point, **they were beaten convincingly just like the other low seeded teams would be.** 

After a few more matches, United Kingdom came out swinging against France. In fact, they swang hard enough to find themselves on match 
point with the opportunity to clinch the game 4-2 over the French. Unfortunately for the brits, **France pulled themselves together to come back and win on tiebreaker.** The fierce battle between the powerhouses goheegy and TimmyAkmed was a delight to watch, but the upsets would have to wait until later.

The nocturnal matches (UTC time) both resulted in upsets. **Chile and South Korea showed a dominant performance against the top seeds 
Australia and Brazil respectively**, only losing 1 map each. Going into the Round Of 16, this put Chile and South Korea in even, winnable 
matchups while Australia and Brazil had tough teams ahead: Taiwan and USA.


The third and final upset of the weekend, Spain versus Indonesia, was a real thriller. After trading close points with each other for 6 
maps, the two teams ended up on tiebreaker where **Spain clutched out the victory.**

For the Round Of 16, this meant that Indonesia would face their fellow top seed France while Spain faced the United Kingdom. Both of 
those were rematches from last year where France and Spain came out on top, so revenge-driven performances from Indonesia and United Kingdom were to be expected.


### Group Stage Mappool

**The nomod picks was the clear favourite for the teams in Groups this year.** One of the most picked maps was Firce777's classic memorization 
map [Yuitsuki yukari - Shiawase ni nareru kakushi komando ga aru rashii](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/219733/#taiko/514465), which is a 
type of map that has not been too popular historically. Instead, the outlier in nomod was the accuracy map [Chroma - Collapse](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/691352#taiko/1463029) 
which surprisingly only got picked twice. 

The rejection of accuracy maps in this stage was made even more apparent by the bans. The OD7 Hidden map [Ice - Entrance](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/755569#taiko/1590333) and 
the sleep inducing DoubleTime pick [FELT - Day After](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/323180#taiko/718430) combined made up almost half of 
all Group Stage bans. 

A word on the picks/bans by [Nwolf](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1910766), one of the map selectors: 

*We were surprised about the huge amount of picks on Shiawase and Goin' Under which we thought would be banned and the high amount of 
bans on Entrance, which we considered the easier HD map.* 


### Round Of 16 Matches

Unlike in the Group Stage, **the Round Of 16 didn't give us any close scorelines.** The 2nd place teams unfortunately only managed to steal 
3 points in total from the group winners.

**Remember those upsets I mentioned?** Brazil's loss to South Korea in the Group Stage meant that they faced the titans of the United States. 
The Brazilians were a couple players short and couldn't get a point on the board against the ruthless accuracies from the US. They are 
still not eliminated though, and will be fighting in the losers bracket to stay in the tournament from this weekend onwards.

Canada and Taiwan made Malaysia and Australia meet the same fate as Brazil and the Maustraysian duo will also be playing in the losers 
bracket from now on.

Things got really interesting in the match between France and Indonesia. The losses of France usually came down to a single misplay, and 
they eventually took a point on the FreeMod [t+pazolite - Elder Dragon Legend (ft. Kabocha)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/761951#taiko/1602056) despite the 
2 mod advantage of Indonesia. Overall though, **Indonesia will take their revenge on France 5-1**, the same score they lost by last year.

Only one Argentinian player woke up for their match, resulting in a **win by default for Japan.**

South Korea edged out Poland on every match they played, but that didn't stop CreepyDuck from pulling off this crazy score on Viden:

Hong Kong missing one of their three players put them in a tough spot against Chile with no replacement players. The accuracy monster sing216 lived up to their reputation by getting 5 scores above 99,9%, 3 of which were SS ranks. The other Hong Kong player, Faputa, couldn't quite match that but still exceeded the expectations of many and helped put Hong Kong on the board. **It ended 5-1 in favour of the Chileans.** 

The last match of the day was also arguably the most even one, United Kingdom vs Spain.  This one could have been significantly closer, but with the small score differences all going the way of Spain, they clinched the match 5-1. However, with the dedication United Kingdom displayed on the memorization map [Black Hole - Pluto](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/599679/#taiko/1599257), **teams in the losers bracket should not take them lightly.**

### Round Of 16 Mappool

**The picks were evenly spread out this week, more so than in the Group Stage anyway.** Across 7 matches, every map was played at least once 
except for tiebreaker. Teams kept it simple by banning out technical maps a lot, such as [onoken - Viden](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/708312/#taiko/1497491) (Hidden) 
and [Virt - Staring at my Spaceship](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/57145/#taiko/766477) (HardRock). 


### Quarterfinals Preview

In the Quarterfinals winners bracket, we'll be seeing: 
Japan vs. Chile, South Korea vs. Indonesia, Spain vs. USA and Taiwan vs. Canada.
**The losers of these matches will drop down to the losers bracket.** Speaking of the losers bracket, the matches we'll be seeing there this weekend are:
Argentina vs. Hong Kong, Poland vs. France, United Kingdom vs. Brazil and Australia vs. Malaysia. 
**The losers of these matches will be eliminated from the tournament.**
