Camellia when? Now.

You asked...

...we delivered.

There is nothing we could possibly say here to make this any greater than it already is.

**156** tracks are now available over at [his Featured Artist](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31) listing, pre-timed and ready to map.

Here's a *VERY* brief snippet of what's on the cards. And by brief we mean one choice from all of the *20* albums that we have:

----------

As with all Featured Artists, any of the tracks on [**Camellia's** listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/31) are 100% free for use in osu!. This also encompasses a vast swathe of the existing beatmaps created since as far back as 2015.

We hope you all understand how agonizing it has been for us to keep this under wraps, but we felt there was truly no better way to send 2018 off than with our **biggest ever** Featured Artist release.

However, in the now immortal words of one Bubbleman - it's not done yet. We're not done yet.

Keep your eyes and ears peeled into 2019, there's more on the horizon!
