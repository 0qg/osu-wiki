Adored by much of the _osu!_ community for her delightfully sweet voice and explosive popularity in the wake of her cover of _Yowamushi Pedal_'s Koi no Hime Hime Pettanko, **\*namirin (＊なみりん)** makes her entrance to the _osu!_ Featured Artist roster with her latest mini-album, *5colors*.

An exploration of her incredible vocal talent, *5colors* is something wonderfully new yet familiar, and we're delighted to share it with the _osu!_ community for use in mapping.

We're excited to see what the intrepid mappers of our community will do with **five** brand new tracks that touch on the vocalist-heavy tastes that are something of a mainstay in the _osu!_ community.

As with all Featured Artists, everything on [**\*namirin**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/18) comes pre-timed in an .osz and is 100% licensed for use in _osu!_, so worry less, and map more!

To build on this even more, we're excited to tease the return of an old contest-esque thing in the coming weeks featuring several of our Featured Artists, of which **\*namirin** will be one. Keep your eyes and ears peeled for more details as they come!
