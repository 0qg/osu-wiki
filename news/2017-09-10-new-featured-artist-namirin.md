Adored by much of the _osu!_ community for her delightfully sweet voice and explosive popularity from her cover of Yowamushi Pedal's _Koi no Hime Hime Pettanko_, [**\*namirin (＊なみりん)**](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/18) makes her entrance to the _osu!_ Featured Artist roster with her latest mini-album, *5colors*.

An exploration of her incredible vocal talent, *5colors* is something wonderfully new yet familiar, and we're delighted to share it with the _osu!_ community for use in mapping.

We're excited to see what the intrepid mappers of our community will do with **five** brand new tracks that touch on the vocalist-heavy tastes that are something of a mainstay in the _osu!_ mapping scene.

As with all Featured Artists, every track on [**\*namirin**'s Featured Artist listing](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/artists/18) comes pre-timed in an .osz and is 100% licensed for use in _osu!_, so worry less, and map more!

To build on this even more, we're excited to tease the return of an old contest-esque thing in the coming weeks, which will spotlight several of our Featured Artists, **\*namirin** among them. 

Keep your eyes and ears peeled for more details as they come!
