After many years of stagnancy, some changes are finally coming to the way Star Rating and Performance Points are calculated! Read on to find out more.

![](/wiki/shared/news/2019-02-05-new-changes-to-star-rating-performance-points/star-rating.jpg)

This effort was led by Xexxar in collaboration with many other community and team members involving themselves via the official [osu! development discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy), where amendments were proposed over the last few months. The end goal was to update a core part of osu!'s competitive progression that hasn't seen any significant changes in many years. With the level of high-end gameplay constantly evolving since the difficulty calculation logic was last touched, these updates are a step towards restoring fairness and sanity to the rating and ranking systems.

While the updates we've just made are not designed to fix *every* issue with the systems as they currently stand, we hope that the changes will allow players to better assess skills that were formerly not factored in properly in previous versions of the algorithm.

Also note that this only affects osu! mode. Other game modes have active tasks in the pipeline and will be applied over the coming months.

# Release Schedule

- As of the time this article is posted, a new stable release will begin recalculating star ratings of all beatmaps loaded locally. This may take a few minutes (or more if you have many beatmaps) and will continue to run in the background while your game is at song select.
- Over the coming hours, server-side star ratings will be updated to match.
- Over the coming days, all existing scores will be recalculated from global rank #1 outwards. You will see your per-play pp and overall pp/rank change as a result.

# Changes in Detail

Without further delay, let's get into the specific changes:

## Wide Angle Jumps

The angle formed between hitobjects is now considered towards the difficulty of jumps. A sinusoidal curve governs the difficulty increase from a minimum of 60 degree jumps to a maximum of 150 degree jumps.

Example beatmap where this change can be seen:
- [MAX COVERI - RUNNING IN THE 90'S](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/739262#osu/1559974)

## High BPM streams

The difficulty rating of patterns consisting of high-paced hitobjects (streams) now increases exponentially from 200 BPM to 330 BPM.

Example beatmap where this change can be seen:
- [UNDEAD CORPORATION - Everything will freeze](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/158023#osu/555797)

## Highly-spaced streams

Streams with very high spacing between hitcircles have been tuned down a bit. These plays are still quite impressive and worth a lot, just not quite as much as before.

Example beatmaps where this change can be seen:
- [GYZE - HONESTY](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/586121#osu/1241370)
- [VINXIS - Sidetracked Day](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/728276#osu/1537566)

## Slider Buffs

The difficulty due to long sliders has been increased significantly.

The effect of this change increases along with the jump distance to the slider increasing and the amount of time between hitobjects decreasing.

Example beatmap where this change can be seen:
- [Fractal - Collide (feat. Danyka Nadeau)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/753365#osu/1586083)

## Flashlight Rework

The amount of performance points awarded due to flashlight has been reduced for short beatmaps and increased for long beatmaps.

Example beatmaps where this change can be seen:
- [Aoi Eir - IGNITE](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/209170#osu/492285) - pp increased
- [Harumachi Clover (Swing Arrangement) [Dictate Edit]](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/859783#osu/1893461) - pp decreased

## Changes to the hidden mod

The amount of performance points awarded due the hidden mod has been increased for beatmaps requiring aim and accuracy, and decreased for high approach rate beatmaps requiring high speed.

Example beatmaps where this change can be seen:
- [GYZE - Honesty](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/586121#osu/1241370) - pp decreased
- [Linkin Park - Guilty All The Same (feat. Rakim)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/518596#osu/1187302) - pp increased

## Misc PP Changes

These are the more minor technical changes that we introduced to fix previous issues and keep things balanced.

- Sliders had excess travel distance due to an off-by-one error during positional calculations and due to the slider end always being considered as a tick.
- The length of sliders was only considered if the next hitobject was also a slider.
- Hitobjects are now stably-sorted, which changes difficulty for some patterns (think circle - circle+spinner combos), but should be more usable going forward.
- The last 400ms of hitobjects in the beatmap was never considered for difficulty.
- To combat potentially unimpressive keyboard mashing that may be common for high speed plays as a result of the new buff, a new reward curve for accuracy has been introduced for the speed skill. Note that this will only punish the speed PP from plays with accuracy under 95%. Aim is unaffected, so your 90% Harumachi Clover FC should still be worth around what it was before. 
- Previously, the algorithm rewarded extra aim PP for plays that were AR10.33+. While we left this in, we reduced the reward and instead introduced the same concept for speed PP as well.  This means that impressive HR+DT plays will now receive a more accurate amount of pp given their difficulty.

----------

We hope that these changes shape up the leaderboard in a way that is both fun and exciting for all players. Stay tuned for more updates in the future and happy clicking!
