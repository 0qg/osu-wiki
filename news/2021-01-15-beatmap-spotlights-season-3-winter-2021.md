How's going, Spotlights rivals! As many of you might've already known, the Autumn Season 2020 is over, and with a little delay we are finally here to announce **Winter Season 2021**!

While we didn't change any essential things regarding league-aspect or general gameplay related things, we will ensure to have this season working smoother along with more recent badges and ranking updates, and better communication with the participants!

We are also seeking new team members so make sure to check out the **[Seeking new curators](#applications)** section if you'd be interested in helping out!

If you can't wait to try out new beatmaps though, **the Beatmap Spotlights lobbies are now open to play on the osu!lazer client**. If you don't know how to participate, check out the **[How to participate](#how-to-participate)** section!

## <a id="how-to-participate"></a> How to participate in Beatmap Spotlights League?

To participate in the Beatmap Spotlights League, you need to download the latest version of osu!lazer client from [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/latest). Once you're done installing, head on to the multiplayer tab and find the right Spotlights lobbies, they can be recognized by a pink bar next to them.

## <a id="applications"></a> Seeking new curators

We are looking for members that are both willing and capable of making decent beatmap selections for upcoming Beatmap Spotlights seasons.

**If you think you've got what it takes to be a part of Spotlights Team, don't hesitate and [apply today!](https://spotlights.team/app)**

The applications will last 2 weeks (ending at 29th January 2021).

## Mappers of the Season

After each season has finalized, the curators will handpick a mapper featured in the Beatmap Spotlights map pool for each gamemode and declare them as the best mapper of the season, netting them a tidy **3 months of osu!supporter** for their efforts.

We're presenting the best of Autumn Season 2020:

Congratulations to those who won! We're hoping to see such great creations in future seasons as well!

## The Future

The new Beatmap Spotlights is still a project on its early development stage and depends a lot on community feedback and engagement to improve. Many things can change and enhancements can be done for future seasons, and it all depends on *your* feedback!

What do you want for the next season? What needs to be fixed? What are your opinions on the current system? You can voice out all your opinions [here](<!-- TODO: create the thread -->) and we will keep note of every suggestion, always seeking for improvement.

We do hope you have enjoyed the Autumn Season 2020, and, of course, we do hope that you enjoy the Winter Season even more. See you in the upcoming timeshift lobbies!
