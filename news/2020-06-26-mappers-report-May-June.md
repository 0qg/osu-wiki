### osu!catch

- **[Dashes and higher-snapped dashes on Rain's](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1033696):** The RC change defined the allowed snap for dashes on Rain difficulties. This clarifies the definition of a higher-snapped dashes which was a problem for almost half a year.

## <a id="mappers-showcase"></a>Mappers' Showcase

The Mappers' Showcase parades lesser-known mappers from every game mode. Since we bundled two issues in one post, this month will feature two game modes. 
Thanks to our selector for osu!catch [Jemzuu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7890134) and our selectors for osu!mania [Scotty](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11085809) & [Unpredictable](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/7560872)!

### Phob 

Recently entering their way in the gates of the ranked section, **[Phob](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6069462)** is a newer mapper that is currently having a decent breakout year so far! Although he's more known for being a skillful Hidden player, his mapping definitely deserves more recognition! He crafts his maps with brilliant relevance to the music showing such coherence in patterning, proving that he clearly knows what he's doing!

His take on [Feint - Snake Eyes (feat, CoMa)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1034056#fruits/2162020) exemplifies the mapping spirit of clean and consistency-based maps, as throughout his difficulties, they were made of superb quality. For a relatively newer mapper, this set was surely impressive! Moreover, his breakcore map, [Lolipusher - why as soon as we become so close, we have to say goodbye?](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1135515#fruits/2437918) manifests that Phob can still stand out regardless of the song's complexity and genre, while still maintaining the players' interest through his solid patterning!

He also tends to favor mapping lower difficulties, especially Salads, so he is certainly a mapper that is in good shape! We are definitely going to watch out for his future works, as he is a very promising mapper! If novice mappers are looking for an inspiration, Phob would be a great example!

### dika312

A long-term mapper that has been crafting maps for almost 5 years, **[dika312](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/741613)** is someone that strives for an intuitive yet a very interesting mapping style that would keep you on the edge of your seat! Despite his long mapping experience, none of dika's works has reached the ranked section (yet!), and most of his maps are sadly gone unnoticed.

A diamond in the rough are his maps such as [Kikuo - Neko no Shokutaku](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/839016#fruits/1756467), where he demonstrated his virtuosity in movement and exquisite patterning to create a gratifying piece of art on such a lovely song. Another solid example would be his rendition of [MALVA. - Trane](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1010141#fruits/2114540), wherein he showed his proficiency in varying platter-motion once again — making use of diverse flow and patterns, leaving a pleasurable experience and taste for mappers and players alike.

Other of his great works that is worth mentioning would be his take on [KikuoHana - Nobore! Susume! Takai Tou](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/545757#fruits/2084234), showcasing exceptional progression in style as the song intensifies, along with fine contrast in calmer sections. We hope to see more of dika's maps, and hopefully he can bear us good fruit in the ranked section someday!

### BringoBrango

**[BringoBrango](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10274043)** is a Canadian mapper who's been within the mapping community for about 2-3 years now and has really made a name for himself within late 2019 to now for his creative innovations and unique takes on the songs he chooses, with his most popular mapset being [Iglooghost - Bug Thief](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/887787#mania/2033667) being ranked late last year and his map, [PSYQUI - Multitalents](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1024323#mania/2142612) being used in last year's MWC.

However, some of his other maps that haven't got much of a spotlight unlike the other two, such as [acloudyskye - Alignment](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1031818#mania/2157673), which perfectly showcase what he's capable of and how to utilize certain aspects to a song to their advantage. The map showcases everything that BringoBrango learned over the course of his mapping career, which turned out excellently as it features LN layering schemes, jacks, heavy use of repetition, utilizing 1/6 and 1/8 flams, and especially the amount of SVs that adds a lot more to the map than it originally had such as stutters, slowjams, speedups, and so much more that perfectly craft this map together into a complex, yet mesmerizing map for anyone that should give it a try.

Other maps of his that definitely deserve more of a spotlight are [cYsmix - Classic Pursuit](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/730295#mania/2235782), which features more LN layering schemes, SVs, inverses, and jacks, to which these hold up the map together beautifully and another map of his, [Husky - Sleepy Boi](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/807991#mania/1695651) which mainly focuses on jacks and SVs with how repetitious the song that really makes the map much more of a challenge and also throws back to an older mapping style of his to where a lot of his mapping were typically jack-oriented. We hope to see more of his maps in the future as he's definitely quite the anomaly in the mapping scene and perhaps see his maps ranked in the future sometime soon!

### Ticle

Despite not being around for long, **[Ticle](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/11602148)** has been able to develop an explosive style of LN mapping. Their takes on electronic tracks are heavily expressive and intuitive yet come with a particular level of detail and rigidity. The result is highly addictive LN maps for both players and mappers alike! Recently, they have been able to gain attention with their debut in the loved section [tomatoism – UMP9](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/970727#mania/2032725). However we believe they have a lot more maps that are worthy of a spotlight.

An example of a map which culminates this is their rendition of [Sta - 99 Glooms](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/961775#mania/2013908). Its liberal usage of flams and more detailed interpretation of the track's various piano and synth are what make this map really shine. Another notable works of theirs is, [sasakure.UK - Jack-the-Ripper](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1130177#mania/2360897), a map featuring complex timing and even more complex representation of the track's guitar sounds. We hope to see Ticle's maps gain more traction as they are definitely worth a shot for any LN enthusiast!

## <a id="around-community"></a>Around the Community

### New Review System in Beatmap Discussion

Modders, listen. We have great news for you! As some may already noticed, modding got an update! The review system which got announced a while ago got finally added to the Beatmap Discussion! What it is you ask?

Some may remember the old modding system which worked through the forum. People posted mods in mappers beatmap forum threads. The difference to the current modding system is that modder could bundle everything in one, huge post if they liked. A lot of modders liked it and still would like to have a similar modding possibility.

And now they finally have! You can now bundle your modding in one, big post! Just like you could in the old beatmap threads. To access it, go into the beatmap discussion of any beatmap you like to mod and then go to the "Review" tab. That's all! Now you can mod like in the old days. Just with all the features which the current modding system offers you!

You think it could be better and something is still missing? Or have you found any bug in it? The devs would love to hear that! Come join the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy) and join the discussion about the review system in the #modding channel! 

### The osu!wiki is hiring

Okay, hiring is maybe the wrong word for it. But on a serious note, the osu!wiki is a huge knowledge database which features topics about everything about osu! Not just mapping and/or modding related such as the entire Ranking Criteria or various guides for mapping, but also all kinds of information, such as the osu! team, various gameplay guides, contests and tournaments and much more.

But sadly it's run by only a few people and a lot of wiki entries are outdated. But good news: Everyone can help! And the people behind the osu!wiki would be surely happy to see more helping hands to update everything and provide the latest information all around osu! 

Contributing is not even that hard and you can get all help you need to get started in the #osu-wiki channel on the [osu!dev Discord server](https://discord.gg/ppy). Do not hesitate to ask there, they won't bite you!

<a id="conclusion"></a>

Phew, that was a bit of a read, right? We're happy that you made it until here! Once again sorry for the long wait. We will work on our schedule to make sure future issues of the Mappers' Report going out in time. You can expect us in the future with the end of every month. Should really not that much happen in osu! we will probably make again one bigger news post, but we try to keep these on a minimum! And please don't forgot, should you have anything interesting and mapping or modding related for us to mention, make sure to tell it to [Feerum](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4815717) or [Noffy](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1541323)!

Until then, thank you for reading and stay safe and healthy!
