**Right off the bat, our first match of [France vs. Chile](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/35585664) ended with an intense tiebreaker.** France may have had the first pick, but Chile emerged as the victor. Both teams had their fair share of convincing wins; a very good showing from both teams. A critical moment saw France losing by a hair on their own pick - [Caravan Palace - Clash](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/646460#mania/1369706). The tiny difference of 94 score was all Chile needed to secure their victory.
