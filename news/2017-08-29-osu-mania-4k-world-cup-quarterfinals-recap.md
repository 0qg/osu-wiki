The Quarterfinals stage marked the start of a new phase in the tournament, where teams fought even harder in an effort to stay on top. Having been separated into the Winner's and Loser's Bracket in the previous stage, many teams were at risk of being eliminated this weekend, though this certainly didn't phase any of them in the slightest. Every single team was determined to make the most of their situation, all in the hopes of making it to the next stage as best they can. 

Without further ado, let's get right into the recap!

## Mappool Statistics<a name="mappool"></a>

**This weekend, we saw a total of 42 picks and 14 bans across 7 complete matches.**

### Saturday

**Right off the bat, our first match of [France vs. Chile ended with an intense tiebreaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/35585664).** France may have had the first pick, but Chile emerged as the victor. Both teams had their fair share of convincing wins; an excellent showing from both teams. A critical moment saw France losing by a hair on their own pick *[Caravan Palace - Clash](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/646460#mania/1369706)*. This tiny difference of *94* score was all Chile needed to secure their eventual victory.

**The next match saw [Argentina put up a good fight against the United Kingdom](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/35588367).** Not ready to take an early exit, the Brits fought fiercely and took the first two points in quick succession. Argentina regained their composure on their second pick, but United Kingdom's determination simply proved too strong, allowing them to win the match 1 - 5.

**Rounding off matches for Saturday, [Canada lost to the United States with 0 - 5](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/35590366)**. The United States was first to pick, and despite the former putting up a good fight, it really didn't take long for them to be defeated. Still, one memorable highlight to take away came in the form of the unholy warmup that was *[noissessoP fo nwapS - noitirappA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/659725#mania/1397099)*. Courtesy of US participant **[stupud man](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2141612)**, the beatmap was a note for note respawn of the original, just in reverse. Frankly, I almost couldn't tell the difference.

### Sunday

**Continuing where we had last left off, [the match between South Korea and Japan also ended with a confident 5 - 0 victory](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/35601021)**. Contrary to the previous match where the matches were fairly one-sided, this encounter was quite a bit closer, with Japan almost beating South Korea on their first pick *[yst - The Lost Dedicated](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1302866)*.
