The Quarterfinals stage marks the start of a new phase in the tournament, where teams fight harder in an effort to remain in the tournament. Having been separated into the Winner's and Loser's Bracket in the previous stage, many teams were at risk of being eliminated this weekend, though this certainly didn't faze any of them in the slightest. 

Every single team was determined to make the most of their situation, all in the hopes of making it to the next stage as best they can. Without further ado, let's get right into the recap!

## Mappool<a name="mappool"></a>

**This weekend, we saw a total of 42 picks and 14 bans across 7 complete matches.** Every map was played at least once, which is always a good indication of mappool diversity and balance. 

### A word from our Mappool Selectors:

*"We were overall quite happy with how the Quarterfinals mappool turned out. As mappool selectors, it certainly is very nice to see every map being picked. Honestly, we were rather surprised by the importance of SV picks throughout this stage. Normally we'd expect these types of maps to be avoided or outright banned, but it seems that they have played an integral role in determining the outcome of several matches."*

*"We do however, express minor regrets over our choice of the [tiebreaker map](https://osu.ppy.sh/b/1038662&m=3). Personally we feel that it could have been more ambitious in challenging players across a wider set of skills. Regardless, it's been a pleasure constructing this mappool for you all."*

### Mappool Statistics:

This week's most popular pick was [yst - The Lost Dedicated](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/617988#mania/1302866), having been played in every single match! The map also holds the distinction of being the "most accurate", though this is mostly because of its easier difficulty compared to the rest of the mappool. [Caravan Palace - Clash](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/646460#mania/1369706) and [NOISIA - Groundhog (Beat Juggle)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/591171#mania/1252742) were also two very popular maps, making appearances in a total of 5 matches each. 

[Blue Stahli - Shotgun Senorita (Zardonic Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/631861#mania/1341515) and [Akira Complex - Odyssey (Au5 Remix)](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/519513#mania/1103630) both made appearances in 6 matches each. The former was a devilishly tricky map featuring many long note patterns, while the latter was very technically demanding, requiring high accuracy. As a result of this, both maps were understandably banned 4 times each. Finally, [Maika - Goldrop](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/587117#mania/1243241) received the least attention, being picked only once across all the matches.

### Saturday:

**Right off the bat, our first match of [France vs. Chile ended with an intense tiebreaker](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/35585664).** France may have had the first pick, but Chile emerged as the victor. Both teams had their fair share of convincing wins; an excellent showing from both teams. A critical moment saw France losing by a hair on their own pick *[Caravan Palace - Clash](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/646460#mania/1369706)*. This tiny difference of *94* score was all Chile needed to secure their eventual victory.

**The next match saw [Argentina put up a good fight against the United Kingdom](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/35588367).** Not ready to take an early exit, the Brits fought fiercely and took the first two points in quick succession. Argentina regained their composure on their second pick, but United Kingdom's determination simply proved too strong, allowing them to win the match 1 - 5.

**Rounding off matches for Saturday, [Canada lost to the United States with 0 - 5](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/35590366)**. The United States was first to pick, and despite the former putting up a good fight, it really didn't take long for them to be defeated. Still, one memorable highlight to take away came in the form of the unholy warmup that was *[noissessoP fo nwapS - noitirappA](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/659725#mania/1397099)*. Courtesy of US participant **[stupud man](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2141612)**, the beatmap was a note for note respawn of the original, just in reverse. Frankly, I almost couldn't tell the difference.

### Sunday:

**Continuing where we had last left off, [the match between South Korea and Japan also ended with a confident 5 - 0 victory](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/35601021)**. Contrary to the previous match where the matches were fairly one-sided, this encounter was quite a bit closer, with Japan almost beating South Korea on their first pick *[yst - The Lost Dedicated](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/1302866)*.

**[New Zealand vs. Poland 0 - 5](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/35602514)**

**[China vs. Singapore 1 - 5](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/35604433)**

**Hong Kong vs. Sweden ended in a WBD in favour of Sweden.**

**The final match of the weekend saw [Brazil triumphing 5 - 1 over Indonesia](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/matches/35608732)**. Brazil started off very strongly, taking 4 points in a row from the top seeded Indonesia. Fearing a sweep, Indonesia gave out one last cry, and convincingly took a point off the dominating Brazillians on their own pick. Brazil definitely showed a strong performance this week, and I cannot wait to see their performance next week.
