With only 6 remaining teams, the past weekend gave us some of the most intense matches yet(including a breathtaking North American derby), which were amplified even more by the evil mappool. Read more to catch up and get ready for the epic Grand Finals stage!

### Finals Matches

**In the first match, Canada claimed their top 4 placing by taking down South Korea 7-3.** The Koreans dominated the speedy nomod picks [Nanoka - Tsukimade Todoke, Fushi no Kemuri](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/763774#taiko/1605963) and [Lily - Scarlet Rose](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/195238#taiko/463330), but that only got them so far. Still though, give it up for South Korea for even 
reaching Finals despite being mid seeded and having such a limited roster. Just imagine what they could accomplish with a bigger roster in future cups...

**The United States proved to be the stronger top seed in their match against Indonesia with a 7-2 win.** The Indonesians did keep it interesting with impressive scores, especially [pmriva](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2180885) who managed a 99,67% Full Combo on [Lily - Scarlet Rose](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/195238#taiko/463330) and only 3 misses on the brutal DoubleTime map [sky_delta VS lapix - NEXT LEVEL](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/623246#taiko/1313652). On the American side, the almost unseen Hidden player [Loopy542](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/5468461) got to shine with a Full Combo of his own on [The GAG Quartet - Breaking Mozart](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/665406#taiko/1408254), just like [janitoreihil](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/3307897) in the previous match.
Although the match didn't go to tiebreaker, the teams still wanted to massacre their hands for the fun of it:

History was repeated and made at the same time in the classic top 2 matchup between Japan and Taiwan in the winners bracket. Japan 
won the match 7-3, but they lost more maps in a match than ever before. If Taiwan rematches Japan in the Grand Final next week and adapts
well to the mappool, they might be able to steal a few more points or maybe even the match, only time will tell.

**This was it. Finally, we had Canada versus United States.** Historically, the match for 3rd place has always been the highlight of the osu!taiko World Cups, and this one will certainly atleast contend with the matches yet to come. Canada has also been seen as the superior North American team these past couple years, but the United States team wanted to change that narrative. The constant notelocking from both sides showed just how immense the pressure was, and how much was at stake. **In the end, United States broke loose with a 3 map win streak to take the win 7-4.** One of their players even celebrated so hard in the chat that they were silenced:

### Finals Mappool

There was bound to be diversity in the picks, since teams required a whole 7 map wins in order to win in this stage. Despite that, [Raiden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2239480)'s FreeMod [The Flashbulb - Passage D](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/587426/#taiko/1243907) has not been played so far, but that might change this weekend. Considering the low amount of matches, the 8 bans were also spread out in the sense that one map from every mod bracket got banned atleast once. As the work for the mappool selectors this year has come to an end, here are their closing comments:
