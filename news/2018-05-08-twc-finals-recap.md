### Finals Matches

**In the first match, Canada claimed their top 4 placing by taking down South Korea 7-3.** ...

**The United States proved to be the stronger top seed in their match against Indonesia with a 7-2 win.** ...

History was repeated and made at the same time in the classic top 2 matchup between Japan and Taiwan in the winners bracket. Japan 
won the match 7-3, but they lost more maps in a match than ever before. If Taiwan rematches Japan in the Grand Final next week and adapts
well to the mappool, they might be able to steal a few more points or maybe even the match, only time will tell.

And finally, we had Canada versus United States ...
