Welcome back everyone!

As some of you may already be aware, it's been another busy month in our fair community, though you've hopefully come to expect that - these articles wouldn't be very exciting if there was nothing interesting to talk about after all! Thankfully, it's also been a month of tremendous growth. With growth comes change, and with changes comes an exciting opportunity for us to tell you all about it! 

One of these changes is that for the first time in months, I won't be presenting this issue alone! Who knows what could happen, so let's get started right away!

## Within the Quality Assurance Team 
by [Raiden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2239480)

People join, people leave. That's how communities evolve throughout history. And the QAT is no different. 
### New Quality Assurance Team additions
Thanks to the QAH initiative explained above, we have determined some of our Beatmap Nominators were qualified enough to become part of our team. With the addition of the new branches explained below, each one of the new QAT members is assigned to one or various branches, making our duties more organized. 

Please give a warm welcome to:
- [-Mo-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2202163) and [Mir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8688812), who will be joining the **Disqualification** branch;
- [Gabe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/654108), who will partake the **Moderation** branch; 
- and finally, [Lanturn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1446665), who will assist the **Metadata** branch.
### Quality Assurance Team retirements
Not everything can always be good news, for it is at times of loss when one really appreciates what one had

- After 5 years of service and countless efforts made for the team, being both in the BAT and the QAT, the judge of mapping contests, co-creator of Beatmap Nominator tests, our long-lasting member [Irreversible](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1287964) has made the decision of working on his own. He will still hold the Olympiad contests, though, so stay alert!
- We also have to bid farewell to [Okoratu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1623405), one of our former QAT leaders. He has chosen to follow his own path while continuing to contribute to the mapping and modding scene by remaining a **Beatmap Nominator**. Being one of the pioneers of the **United Beat-Knights of the Ranking Criteria**, he worked tremendously hard to make our Ranking Criterias a dynamic set of rules that adapt to the evolution of the mapping scene. On top of that, he is also one of the founders and main organizers of the **Mentorship Program** as well as one of the promoters of **Mapping with Rewards**, making his departure indubitably a great loss for the QAT.
### Overview of the new workfields (Branches) 
"In the beginning, there was chaos." Not any longer, though! One of the most important changes within the Quality Assurance Team has been the creation of the work **branches**. In order to keep the QAT's workload organized and proportionally divided, we have now the following branches of work:
- **Metadata branch**: the primary job of the members of this branch is to check the metadata of qualified maps, in order to ensure proper metadata (artist, title, source, tags...). **Members**: [Kurai (L)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/77089), [Doyak](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2046893), [Fycho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1876867) and [Lanturn](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1446665).
- **Disqualification branch**: this branch's purpose is mainly to check the reports made by the Quality Assurance Helpers explained above, inform of their validity and disqualify maps accordingly. **Members**: [Mao (L)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2204515), [Myxomatosis (L)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2202645), [Fycho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1876867), [Lasse](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/896613), [Mir](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8688812), [-Mo-](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2202163), [Gabe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/654108), [Raiden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2239480), [Nardoxyribonucleic](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/876419), [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508), [Deif](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/318565), [Kurokami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/260933), [Asherz007](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/9014047) and [Protastic101](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6712747). 
- **Moderation Branch**: a branch that spawned with the only purpose of moderating inappropriate beatmap submissions (NSFW content, stolen beatmaps...). **Members**: [Kurai (L)](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/77089), [JBHyperion](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/4879508), [Raiden](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/2239480), [Deif](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/318565), [Kurokami](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/260933), [Fycho](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/1876867) and [Gabe](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/654108).
