With 2017 just behind us, 2018 looks to bring many new experiences to osu! To help us start off the new year, let us reach back into something that was once in the past. After a long hiatus, we are thrilled to announce the revival of official beatmapping contests: Welcome to the _osu! Mapping Olympiad!_

The osu! Mapping Olympiad aims to ensure mapping contests across all game modes on a regular schedule. We won't *quite* say it'll be monthly, but it'll hopefully be close to that, run by a small team of community members that are just as excited for more contests as you are!

To keep things interesting, we will be hosting a number of different contest formats, from traditional full mapset contests to speedmapping, Aspire and other new contests -- so stay tuned in the upcoming months!

## Songs

To start off, we are launching this first contest with not one, but **three** songs for you to choose from! Showcasing a variety of our Featured Artists, have yourself a listen to the tracks you have the opportunity to tackle:

From one of the most well known artists in osu! comes another upbeat pop track infused with electronic elements that give it a dynamic twist: Kuba Oms - Beautiful Uncertainty (Redux)!

And last but certainly not least, this laid back track features playful melodies that float gently over a trance and house inspired groove: cYsmix - Escapism!

- Hitsounding (5P) - How well does the entry utilize hitsounding to emphasize and follow the music?

**We are looking for capable judges! If you are interested, please post in the [Judging Call thread](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/691326) or send a message to [Chaos](https://osu.ppy.sh/u/2628870). Please be aware that we can only accept people who have the resources (knowledge, time, reliability) to properly judge the entries.**

## Prizes

After the entries have been judged and the results have been finalized, each of the top three maps for each track will receive the following prizes:

- **1st place**: 3 months of osu!supporter, 6 Olympiad Points (Results in 'Mapping Olympian' Badge)
- **2nd place**: 2 months of osu!supporter, 4 Olympiad Points
- **3rd place**: 1 months of osu!supporter, 2 Olympiad Points

For Olympiad contests, we will be using a point system to award the 'Mapping Olympian' badge. This means that top placing results across multiple contests will grant you the opportunity to be awarded a badge even if you do not win a contest. Every 6 points earned will grant you a level of the badge, with incrementation on the badge for each level achieved. The expected baseline for points rewards will be 6,4,2 for the top 3 entries respectively but the specific rewards will vary per contest based on expected effort and challenge for the participants.

Some of you may be wonder where the *Elite Mapper* title for this contest. We considered a few options but none provided an adequate balance between fairness, demonstrating mapping prowess, and integrity for this particular contest. We will have contests in the future where the title will be rewarded.

The contest will remain open for **24 days** from the date of this post. Download the pre-timed .osz files below:
